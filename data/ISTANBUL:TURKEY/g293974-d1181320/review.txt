This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room.

Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments.

Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight.

It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable.

This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room.

Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments.

Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight.

It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable.

This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room.

Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments.

Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight.

It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable.

This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room.

Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments.

Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight.

It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable.

This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room.

Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments.

Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight. The staff went out of their way to help us retrieve it -- which involved several calls on their part to the airport luggage lost and found and intercepting a delivery to the hotel which would have arrived after our departure. By the way, we recommend Effendi travel service for easy access from the airport to this or any other hotel in Istanbul. Check their online site.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel.

We have stayed in Istanbul a number of times, and this time thought we would try this hotel. Booking via thier website and followup prior to trip could not be faulted. we organised a pick up from the airport with the hotel, and just like they advised, the person was there to meet our flight wth a sign with our name on, and took us to the hotel. Having the pickup from the airport ensures you do not have trouble explaining to a driver the locality of the hotel, or trying to find it. Saves a lot of stress. The hotel itself was very nice and very, very clean. The only thing is you must be aware that there is no lift, so if you are staying on an upper level, you will have a number of steps to climb, each time you go out and come in. But not so many steps to breakfast which is served on the top floor. You canniot have it both ways, have to pick between less steps to breakfast, or less steps to your room. Speaking of breakfast, it is superb, with a very wide range of foods including european and turkish. A lot of it homemade. The staff were really lovely and very helpful. Even lent up a card for bus travel to put money on to save having to purchase tichets all the time. The locality is excellent, and close to everything. (See their website) The room we had was perfect and we would definately stay here again if we were wanting to stay in the Sultanhmet of Istanbul.

I had a brief stay in Istanbul and choose this hotel because of its cheap price, what I got in return was a gem. It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.

This hotel is exactly what is claims to be - an historic but adapted old house in the center of the historic Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. Good: Location - it is an easy (if slightly uphill) walk to the main tourist sites of the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia and the Tokapi Palace. This also means that you can easily use the tram system to access the city (Sultanhamet is a stop on the T1 line) and get to the ferry terminal. Clean - very and the rooms are well cared for each day. Comfortable - good air con, well double glazed windows against the city noise and nice firm beds. Breakfast - buffet style breakfast on the roof terrace is an easy way to start the day with pleasant views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Staff - always helpful and polite but not too much - perfect balance. Very close to many restaurants - if you want to eat close to the hotel. Comment: They make this clear but be aware that that it is not suitable for people with mobility issues - there is no elevator and access to breakfast is up 4 flights of steep marble stairs / spiral staircase. Of course, your room might be lower down. There is no need to worry about cases - the staff will help with those. You cannot expect the facilities of a modern purpose built hotel in the building like this - but you should know that before booking.

We had an overnight layover planned for istanbul in preparation for the next leg of our trip and wanted a hotel in the Old City near the major sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc.). This hotel ranked high in Tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. The price was good as well. All of the staff were very helpful. The hotel is small (to our liking). Breakfast is served on the top floor which has a terrace as well as inside space with nice views of the surroundings. The breakfast was very good. A telling example of the quality of service: Our luggage was delayed and we had only 24 h to retrieve it before our next flight.

It's an 8 minute walk from the Blue Mosque which means its in the centre of the Old Town and important tourist area. This also means the area feels safe and has plenty of food, shops and transport links - plus it's not too far from the seafront fish restaurants. The room was clean and had the all important air-con. The en-suite was perfect and also clean. The breakfast bar on the roof terrace might be a few flights of stairs away, but is a fantastic start to a day of sight seeing. Looking across the water watching the morning ships pass, drinking Turkish coffee. The staff were more than helpful and friendly. When I arrived 6 hours before my room was booked they offered me a free breakfast. If I return to Istanbul - which is likely as the City is fantastic - I will definitely try to stay here again.

We were extremely satisfied with our three-day stay at Osmanhan Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. It was very close to many measure attractions. The rooms were well-equipped and clean. The people working at the hotel were all polite and helpful. When we arrived, they serviced some drinks before check-in. We enjoyed talking with them when we went out, came back and also at the breakfast time. The breakfast was also wonderful. we can't forget the sea view from the terrace at which we had breakfast. highly recommended.

This is a great hotel, fairly priced and with very helpful and welcoming staff, It's within an easy walk to the main sights of the old town and nearby to a good selection of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed the appetising breakfasts out on the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The Osmanhan Hotel is a great hotel. It is located within walking distance of Old City sites and excellent restaurants. The full breakfast, included in the hotel fee, was plentiful and delicious. The hotel staff was very friendly and most helpful.

Staff always very nice and helpful, very convenient location within ten minutes walk of major monuments. Booked 3 nights in ground floor room and one night in standard room but was upgraded to standard room for the whole stay and eventually upgraded to deluxe room following air conditioning failure!

We stayed at Osmanhan Hotel for three days. It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. Hotel is situated in old city within 5-10 minutes walk of major sight-seeing places, shops and restaurants. The owner and staff are extremely kind and helpful. The room is adequate size, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast is fantastic. While we had the fresh and delicious brekafast, we also enjoyed the panoramic sea view from the terrace. Osmanhan Hotel is fabulous!

Everything that everyone has written is right - extraordinary service by people who genuinely appear to enjoy their job. The rooms are clean and the wifi is reliable. The rooftop breakfast room and terrace are beautiful. The location is ideal for the tourist sites. In short, if you are here for a short holiday, this is the place.
