This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming.

The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists.

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it.

The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites. Room Tip: If you have trouble with some stairs ask for the ground floor room - its behind reception but you do... See more room tips

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August.

We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking.

Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites. Room Tip: If you have trouble with some stairs ask for the ground floor room - its behind reception but you do... See more room tips

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam.

Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites. Room Tip: If you have trouble with some stairs ask for the ground floor room - its behind reception but you do... See more room tips

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours.

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever.

It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments.

If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home.

Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites. Room Tip: If you have trouble with some stairs ask for the ground floor room - its behind reception but you do... See more room tips

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel.

When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites. Room Tip: If you have trouble with some stairs ask for the ground floor room - its behind reception but you do... See more room tips

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg.

The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites. Room Tip: If you have trouble with some stairs ask for the ground floor room - its behind reception but you do... See more room tips

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly.

The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul.

Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that.

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional.

At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea.

The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it.

If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming.

The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists.

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it.

The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites. Room Tip: If you have trouble with some stairs ask for the ground floor room - its behind reception but you do... See more room tips

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August.

We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking.

Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites. Room Tip: If you have trouble with some stairs ask for the ground floor room - its behind reception but you do... See more room tips

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam.

Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites. Room Tip: If you have trouble with some stairs ask for the ground floor room - its behind reception but you do... See more room tips

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours.

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever.

It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments.

If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home.

Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites. Room Tip: If you have trouble with some stairs ask for the ground floor room - its behind reception but you do... See more room tips

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel.

When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites. Room Tip: If you have trouble with some stairs ask for the ground floor room - its behind reception but you do... See more room tips

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg.

The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites. Room Tip: If you have trouble with some stairs ask for the ground floor room - its behind reception but you do... See more room tips

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly.

The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul.

Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that.

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional.

At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea.

The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it.

If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming.

The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists.

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it.

The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites. Room Tip: If you have trouble with some stairs ask for the ground floor room - its behind reception but you do... See more room tips

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August.

We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking.

Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites. Room Tip: If you have trouble with some stairs ask for the ground floor room - its behind reception but you do... See more room tips

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam.

Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites. Room Tip: If you have trouble with some stairs ask for the ground floor room - its behind reception but you do... See more room tips

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours.

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever.

It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments.

If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home.

Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites. Room Tip: If you have trouble with some stairs ask for the ground floor room - its behind reception but you do... See more room tips

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel.

When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites. Room Tip: If you have trouble with some stairs ask for the ground floor room - its behind reception but you do... See more room tips

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg.

The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites. Room Tip: If you have trouble with some stairs ask for the ground floor room - its behind reception but you do... See more room tips

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly.

The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul.

Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that.

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional.

At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea.

The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it.

If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming.

The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists.

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it.

The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites. Room Tip: If you have trouble with some stairs ask for the ground floor room - its behind reception but you do... See more room tips

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August.

We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites.

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam. We stayed there largely on the basis of Matthew L's 5 Star review in March 2014, and are happy to report that his comments are still on the mark in mid August. We had a lovely suite with a private terrace garden (Room 201), which was an oasis. Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking.

Staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and effortless perfection, and we have never been welcomed better at any of the "big name" 5 Star hotels we have enjoyed (Leading Hotels of the World, Four Seasons, etc.) The block on which the hotel is located must have at least 12 cafe style restaurants serving traditional Turkish cuisine to tourists. Staff will recommend the two gems where the food and ambiance are far superior to their neighbors, including open air terraces, some with views of the sea. We dined happily at Magnaura Cafe across the street, and will post a separate (glowing) review. The hotel is literally steps from the top tourist sites described above, making it a perfect location for first-timers to Istanbul. At the same time, its casual luxury and ambiance make it a desired location for return visitors Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Room Tip: We loved 201 See more room tips

Stayed at the Millennium Suites for 4 nights in July 2014. The location is ideal for exploring the tourist attractions in the old city. The rooms are cozy but clean and well maintained. Despite having a street facing room, the dwelling was not noisy at all. The room offered various complimentary drinks including water, soda, iced tea, the usual makings for tea and coffee and others. The complimentary breakfast was a very good spread of items including eggs and coffee were available to order as desired. The staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. The management requested us to change our room to accommodate a family and provided a complimentary half a day Bosphorous cruise as a thank you. The staff always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and we are glad to have stayed in this lovely hotel.

I was surprised to see how the Millenium Suites in Istanbul was rated (2 out of 700+hotels) that I was compelled to write this review. I love tripadvisor and rely on people's comments. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the Old Town and the sites. It also has a very nice breakfast included. However, the lobby and rooms are fine but nothing special (not a 5 star ranking) Our room was on a lower floor and facing the street. It was extremely noisy at night with all the cafÃ©s and street life outside ....up until 2am. The people in the hotel were nice enough but I would definitely rank this in a mid range and not the top of the group. Room Tip: One high above street and preferably not facing it are probably quieter See more room tips

We had the great pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for several nights recently. We travelled to several cities in Europe (throughout Greece and other parts of Turkey). Istanbul is a wonderfully diverse city and this hotel is perfectly located in the most central of areas - a perfect place to stay. Alper (and Yalcin) and all the staff at this hotel are the most wonderfully attentive and caring people that we have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel like we were finally 'at home'. I can't say enough about the hotel and the staff and service - this is a truly 5+ star place to stay...do not hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it. Our warmest wishes to Alper and Yalcin from Doug and Theresa in Toronto! Cheers!

This boutique hotel converted me to the boutique experience! I had never before tried anything but the chain hotels. It changed my entire view of that. The hotel manager, Celal, and his staff, Soner, Handan, Czengis, and Ibrahim left us completely pampered and wanting for nothing. A delicious spread greeted us for breakfast, and their smiling faces made fast friends of us. They continued throughout the week in Istanbul to be our trusted advisors and friends. Truly. Please do consider this very highly on your next trip to Istanbul!

Let me start by saying there should be 6 stars for the level of service provided by the staff of this hotel. Every possible need was attended to even when it had nothing to do with the hotel. Little things like fresh flowers everyday, free mini bar with beer and cold water, breakfast held over for the jet lagged guests that sleep in, booking other hotels, tour guide, events, dinner reservations and even assistance with an ALS ice bucket Every amenity we requested was hand delivered as we relaxed on the terrace/patio. We stayed 5 nights and would like to say thanks to the manager Ãelal and the hospitable staff: Handan, Soner and Dzhengis for making the hotel our second home. I will always remember the connections we made with the staff. Room Tip: We were on the first floor to the left. A little more noise at night but nothing that couldn't b... See more room tips

Staff were extremely friendly and eager to please. Given the location I understand previous comments re the noise, however we were on the ground floor at the back so heard no noise after hours. If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be anonymous and blend into the background this isnt a hotel for you - but if you would like to feel a warm welcome every time you come through the doors then this is the place to stay. Location-wise we liked that we were in easy walking distance to all the attractions and rarely had to take a taxi or tram and being in a more touristy location meant we felt safe, and especially me as a woman didnt have to worry as much about clothing. The only downside of the location was that the street is lined with restauranteurs keen to get your business, so when leaving the hotel at night it was a bit tough to run the gauntlet - they were all nice enough which made it hard to say no and keep walking. Overall would highly recommend especially if you only have a few days in Istanbul and are keen to see the historical sites. Room Tip: If you have trouble with some stairs ask for the ground floor room - its behind reception but you do... See more room tips

We stayed for one night en route for Manchester. The location is ideal for sight seeing. The hotel staff were solicitous and genuinely welcoming. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and the breakfast delicious. The hotel arranged for transport both to and from the airport, which was very professional. All in all we felt that we had found a jewel and hope to return. If you are looking for the sterile luxury of a five star chain hotel you would be disappointed, but if you are looking to stay somewhere where the staff genuinely care and you are made to feel special, but not in a over bearing way, this is the place to stay!!

As many have aleady said, the staff here do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. The location for all the major sights could not be better with all in walking distance. Also the tram line is easily accessed to get to other parts like the ferry terminal. The rooms are very good, clean and comfortable with good sized bathroom etc. WIFI is free and works very well with speeds around 5 meg. Breakfast is a buffet arrangement but they will cook eggs to order including omelettes. When it comes to dinner, there are some great places on the door step. One of the best is just opposite. TIP. When making your travel arrangement it is a good idea to get the staff here to arrange your transfers. Taxis are somewhat unreliable when it comes to payment. The hotel will fix your transfers at a very good price and include it on your bill. Relaxing. We loved it and will stay again when next in Istanbul.

A small friendly hotel with a really great friendly staff. Very good pairs of rooms. The kids thought the whirlpool baths the best thing ever. Free minibar, every trouble taken, extended check out time.. good advice on what to do. Location is excellent for all the tourist sites of old Istanbul. We want to go back. Room Tip: Think they are all good! They come in pairs. See more room tips

In the heart of Sultanahmet, close to Haggia Sophia, the obelisk, the underground cistern, Topkapi Palace and all the other major museums and sites in old town Istanbul, Millenium Suites is a world apart. A small (7 rooms) luxury townhome, the property reminds me of a private canal house in Amsterdam.
