We thoroughly enjoyed our two nights at The World Heritage hotel. Yusuf is a wonderful host so helpful and friendly, he was always prepared to spend time with you helping you plan your sightseeing for the day or helping out with any problems you may have. The staff were all really nice and friendly. The hotel was in an excellent position close to the tram, shops, restaurant, Grand Bazaar etc Yusuf supplied free drinks in the fridge in the room plus tea and homemade cakes which were available in the reception area and were delicious. The morning we had to leave for the airport before breakfast, Yusuf arranged for us to be given an early breakfast which was very nice. A lovely place to stay, I can recommend it highly.

I liked everything about the hotel everything was fantastic, the staff could be more friendly, but nothing that estragsse me to stay. The rooms are superb. Everyone should visit this hotel to be happier people

We stayed at World Heritage Hotel Istanbul because of the reviews on trip advisor, and yes they are true - Yusuf and his team could not have been more helpful and genuinely hospitable. This is not a 5 star hotel with a pool and gym its a comfortable quirky small hotel in a great central location - 5 minutes or less to the Blue Mosque - World Heritage is a hotel you want to shout about and one you will want to return to.

My wife and I enjoyed a fabulous stay at the World Heritage Hotel, Sultanahmet, Istanbul. This is a charming boutique hotel in a great location, within a short walk from the all the attractions, shops and restaurants in the old town. The service could not have been better, the staff were very welcoming and helpful and, as others have pointed out, there is always a selection of coffee and cakes available. The hotel is also excellent value for money, you could easily pay a lot more for a hotel which is not nearly as good as the WHH. We have already recommended this hotel to friends who are thinking of visiting Istanbul.

This hotel was a great choice. Attentive and kind staff, they will offer you a cup of tea or coffee and cake everyday when you arrive from your sightseeing. Yusuf (at the reception) will take 30 minutes and explain you important things for your visit on your arrival, recommending restaurants and things to do or not to do. We followed his recommendations and everything was just great. Breakfast was very good. They will have cold soft drinks at your minibar everyday for free!

I know I'm not adding anything the others before me haven't said, but this place is truly excellent. We travel a lot, and I think I'm pretty good at finding hotels that have great locations, good value, and other important intangibles. This hotel is everything we ever could have asked for! As others have pointed out, Yusef is wonderful. And so is his staff. He is jovial, knowledgable, flexible, and he truly cares about your visit. Everyone we interacted with at the hotel really, really wanted you to love your stay there, and that's something I have yet to find in even the nicest (in terms of star ratings) hotels I've been to. As others have mentioned, he will give you maps, and outline an itinerary for you that he thinks will allow you to make the best of your stay in Istanbul. He's very knowledgable about how to get around, and offers up little shortcuts here and there to make your life easier. The hotel itself is fantastic. It is a two minute walk from the Sultanahmet tram station, which will get you basically anywhere you need to go. While it is in walking distance from most of the major attractions, it also somehow isn't in the middle of the really touristy part of the old city, which saves you from being accosted by every store and restaurant owner when you're ready to wrap up your night. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the room clean and modern. From the pictures, I thought the bathroom was a little kitchy (with the gold trim and all), but when you see it in person, you see that's it's a very thoughtfully put together accommodation. The free minibar is amazing, because elsewhere on our trip throughout Turkey and Greece, water was expensive and not easy to come by. The breakfasts are fantastic. There is no reason to have the wide selection they have - and yet they do! And they'll make you an omelette if you really want one, but just trust me and eat the menemen or cheese pie. Every afternoon or evening, when you're coming in for a recharge or to rest up for the next day, there is complimentary Turkish Tea and cakes. More often than not, they would rather make the tea for you so you can relax. And it is all very, very tasty. In additional to all of that (and I think that's enough!), at one point in our stay, there was a child just screaming in the hotel. It was during the day, not a big deal, but as we were heading out I mentioned that someone had a really unhappy child to Yusef. He explained to me that the family of five was just spending a few hours in that room until they could catch their plane. Their flight into Istanbul had been severely delayed, and it was thunderstorming outside, so the family was just looking for a place to spend a few hours to dry off and warm up until it was time to go back to the airport. Yusef let them have the room for a while, and for next to no money, after other hotels had told them they would have to pay for a full night. That's the kind of guy I want to give my business to.

Many many thanks to Yousuf, Ebru and Omit( hope i got his spelling correct) for the best hospitality ever shown to us. They made our trip to IStanbul more than pleasant.Perfect location,clean rooms, fantastic breakfast spread,lovely cakes/cookies freshly everyday and the innumerable cups of turkish coffee makes this place the ideal holiday haven.Must go people ..

This hotel ticks all the boxes for a stay in Istanbul - right in the middle of all the action, reasonably priced, clean and tidy and an extensive breakfast to start the day off. Yusef goes out of his way to make sure that his guests have a great time - he'll tell you what to see, what not to bother with, how to get around and how to get the best deals on visiting the sights and using Istanbul's seriously good public transport system.

Firstly a HUGE thank you to the many (previous) reviewers who took the time out to post reviews. I did some research when planning for my holiday to Istanbul and after reading your positive reviews; decided to go with World Heritage Hotel. They offer an array of complimentary sumptuous cakes and melt in the mouth biscuits with beverage at reception (as standard!) which is a lovely gesture and much appreciated after a long day of touring/sightseeing, this in addition to a great breakfast selection of bread, jam, cereal, pastries, omelettes, savoury Turkish egg/cheese pancakes, cold meats, sausages etc. They also have a minibar which is replenished each and every day with a selection of drinks and water (my children were in drinks heaven!). House keeping is also carried out very well, good quality bed/VERY comfortable mattresses with linen to complement the tasteful furnishing too; bedsheets/duvet/pillow cases changed everyday (as well as slippers) and toiletries generously replenished too. There is wi-fi too which is great for keeping in contact digitally. It is situated at a prime location, minutes away (walking distance!) from all the famous landmarks such as Blue Mosque, Hippodrome, Hagia Sophia etc therefore being cost effective as you will save money on transport (as we did!). Secondly, the customer service is EXCELLENT - from the moment we arrived, we felt looked after. They were very attentive, caring and extremely helpful as well as fostering a very warm and friendly atmosphere in general. The team; Manager Yusuf, Supervisor Ebru, Fathi, Yashar, Umit & Co all worked very hard to ensure that we had a comfortable stay - we felt right at home and all felt as though we were all part of an extended family! We stayed for 5 days and their standards were unfaltering, their service faultless. Their local knowledge and insight was invaluable too in arranging our own tours. Everyday; either Yusuf or Ebru would recommend places and actually mark out the journey on maps (which would require a lot of patience as I'm hopeless with maps!), they have handy which made visiting places just that much more easier; in fact, the only thing they didn't do is accompany us to the trip (for obvious reasons!). Both my children thoroughly enjoyed their stay too, so much so - they didn't want to leave! You will not be disappointed as we weren't nor the many others. Yusuf/Ebru - many many thanks from the Rahim family, we'll definitely be staying at your hotel if we visit Istanbul again.

From the time we checked into this hotel to the departure, the staff couldn't have been more helpful and friendly. They truly made us feel welcomed. We love the location which is so close to everything, to all the sight seeings, tons of good restaurants around all within easy walking distance. Room is fairly good size and very clean. Bed was comfortable, room has nice decor. Only complaint is the bathroom size being so small. Breakfast was pretty good which was included with the room. They serve afternoon tea/coffee with sweets in the lobby which is a very nice gesture. The thing really stands out with this hotel is that everyone from the front desk to the bellboy is so hospitable. It was such a pleasant stay!

It is situated at a prime location, minutes away (walking distance!) from all the famous landmarks such as Blue Mosque, Hippodrome, Hagia Sophia etc therefore being cost effective as you will save money on transport (as we did!). Secondly, the customer service is EXCELLENT - from the moment we arrived, we felt looked after. They were very attentive, caring and extremely helpful as well as fostering a very warm and friendly atmosphere in general. The team; Manager Yusuf, Supervisor Ebru, Fathi, Yashar, Umit & Co all worked very hard to ensure that we had a comfortable stay - we felt right at home and all felt as though we were all part of an extended family! We stayed for 5 days and their standards were unfaltering, their service faultless. Their local knowledge and insight was invaluable too in arranging our own tours. Everyday; either Yusuf or Ebru would recommend places and actually mark out the journey on maps (which would require a lot of patience as I'm hopeless with maps!), they have handy which made visiting places just that much more easier; in fact, the only thing they didn't do is accompany us to the trip (for obvious reasons!). Both my children thoroughly enjoyed their stay too, so much so - they didn't want to leave! You will not be disappointed as we weren't nor the many others. Yusuf/Ebru - many many thanks from the Rahim family, we'll definitely be staying at your hotel if we visit Istanbul again.

From the time we checked into this hotel to the departure, the staff couldn't have been more helpful and friendly. They truly made us feel welcomed. We love the location which is so close to everything, to all the sight seeings, tons of good restaurants around all within easy walking distance. Room is fairly good size and very clean. Bed was comfortable, room has nice decor. Only complaint is the bathroom size being so small. Breakfast was pretty good which was included with the room. They serve afternoon tea/coffee with sweets in the lobby which is a very nice gesture. The thing really stands out with this hotel is that everyone from the front desk to the bellboy is so hospitable. It was such a pleasant stay! Room Tip: Room in the back facing the courtyard is quiet. See more room tips

We thoroughly enjoyed our two nights at The World Heritage hotel. Yusuf is a wonderful host so helpful and friendly, he was always prepared to spend time with you helping you plan your sightseeing for the day or helping out with any problems you may have. The staff were all really nice and friendly. The hotel was in an excellent position close to the tram, shops, restaurant, Grand Bazaar etc Yusuf supplied free drinks in the fridge in the room plus tea and homemade cakes which were available in the reception area and were delicious. The morning we had to leave for the airport before breakfast, Yusuf arranged for us to be given an early breakfast which was very nice. A lovely place to stay, I can recommend it highly.

I liked everything about the hotel everything was fantastic, the staff could be more friendly, but nothing that estragsse me to stay. The rooms are superb. Everyone should visit this hotel to be happier people

We stayed at World Heritage Hotel Istanbul because of the reviews on trip advisor, and yes they are true - Yusuf and his team could not have been more helpful and genuinely hospitable. This is not a 5 star hotel with a pool and gym its a comfortable quirky small hotel in a great central location - 5 minutes or less to the Blue Mosque - World Heritage is a hotel you want to shout about and one you will want to return to.

My wife and I enjoyed a fabulous stay at the World Heritage Hotel, Sultanahmet, Istanbul. This is a charming boutique hotel in a great location, within a short walk from the all the attractions, shops and restaurants in the old town. The service could not have been better, the staff were very welcoming and helpful and, as others have pointed out, there is always a selection of coffee and cakes available. The hotel is also excellent value for money, you could easily pay a lot more for a hotel which is not nearly as good as the WHH. We have already recommended this hotel to friends who are thinking of visiting Istanbul.

This hotel was a great choice. Attentive and kind staff, they will offer you a cup of tea or coffee and cake everyday when you arrive from your sightseeing. Yusuf (at the reception) will take 30 minutes and explain you important things for your visit on your arrival, recommending restaurants and things to do or not to do. We followed his recommendations and everything was just great. Breakfast was very good. They will have cold soft drinks at your minibar everyday for free!

I know I'm not adding anything the others before me haven't said, but this place is truly excellent. We travel a lot, and I think I'm pretty good at finding hotels that have great locations, good value, and other important intangibles. This hotel is everything we ever could have asked for! As others have pointed out, Yusef is wonderful. And so is his staff. He is jovial, knowledgable, flexible, and he truly cares about your visit. Everyone we interacted with at the hotel really, really wanted you to love your stay there, and that's something I have yet to find in even the nicest (in terms of star ratings) hotels I've been to. As others have mentioned, he will give you maps, and outline an itinerary for you that he thinks will allow you to make the best of your stay in Istanbul. He's very knowledgable about how to get around, and offers up little shortcuts here and there to make your life easier. The hotel itself is fantastic. It is a two minute walk from the Sultanahmet tram station, which will get you basically anywhere you need to go. While it is in walking distance from most of the major attractions, it also somehow isn't in the middle of the really touristy part of the old city, which saves you from being accosted by every store and restaurant owner when you're ready to wrap up your night. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the room clean and modern. From the pictures, I thought the bathroom was a little kitchy (with the gold trim and all), but when you see it in person, you see that's it's a very thoughtfully put together accommodation. The free minibar is amazing, because elsewhere on our trip throughout Turkey and Greece, water was expensive and not easy to come by. The breakfasts are fantastic. There is no reason to have the wide selection they have - and yet they do! And they'll make you an omelette if you really want one, but just trust me and eat the menemen or cheese pie. Every afternoon or evening, when you're coming in for a recharge or to rest up for the next day, there is complimentary Turkish Tea and cakes. More often than not, they would rather make the tea for you so you can relax. And it is all very, very tasty. In additional to all of that (and I think that's enough!), at one point in our stay, there was a child just screaming in the hotel. It was during the day, not a big deal, but as we were heading out I mentioned that someone had a really unhappy child to Yusef. He explained to me that the family of five was just spending a few hours in that room until they could catch their plane. Their flight into Istanbul had been severely delayed, and it was thunderstorming outside, so the family was just looking for a place to spend a few hours to dry off and warm up until it was time to go back to the airport. Yusef let them have the room for a while, and for next to no money, after other hotels had told them they would have to pay for a full night. That's the kind of guy I want to give my business to. Room Tip: I don't think there's a bad room at this hotel, but the rooms at the back of the hotel seem... See more room tips

Many many thanks to Yousuf, Ebru and Omit( hope i got his spelling correct) for the best hospitality ever shown to us. They made our trip to IStanbul more than pleasant.Perfect location,clean rooms, fantastic breakfast spread,lovely cakes/cookies freshly everyday and the innumerable cups of turkish coffee makes this place the ideal holiday haven.Must go people ..

This hotel ticks all the boxes for a stay in Istanbul - right in the middle of all the action, reasonably priced, clean and tidy and an extensive breakfast to start the day off. Yusef goes out of his way to make sure that his guests have a great time - he'll tell you what to see, what not to bother with, how to get around and how to get the best deals on visiting the sights and using Istanbul's seriously good public transport system.

Firstly a HUGE thank you to the many (previous) reviewers who took the time out to post reviews. I did some research when planning for my holiday to Istanbul and after reading your positive reviews; decided to go with World Heritage Hotel. They offer an array of complimentary sumptuous cakes and melt in the mouth biscuits with beverage at reception (as standard!) which is a lovely gesture and much appreciated after a long day of touring/sightseeing, this in addition to a great breakfast selection of bread, jam, cereal, pastries, omelettes, savoury Turkish egg/cheese pancakes, cold meats, sausages etc. They also have a minibar which is replenished each and every day with a selection of drinks and water (my children were in drinks heaven!). House keeping is also carried out very well, good quality bed/VERY comfortable mattresses with linen to complement the tasteful furnishing too; bedsheets/duvet/pillow cases changed everyday (as well as slippers) and toiletries generously replenished too. There is wi-fi too which is great for keeping in contact digitally. It is situated at a prime location, minutes away (walking distance!) from all the famous landmarks such as Blue Mosque, Hippodrome, Hagia Sophia etc therefore being cost effective as you will save money on transport (as we did!).

He explained to me that the family of five was just spending a few hours in that room until they could catch their plane. Their flight into Istanbul had been severely delayed, and it was thunderstorming outside, so the family was just looking for a place to spend a few hours to dry off and warm up until it was time to go back to the airport. Yusef let them have the room for a while, and for next to no money, after other hotels had told them they would have to pay for a full night. That's the kind of guy I want to give my business to.

Many many thanks to Yousuf, Ebru and Omit( hope i got his spelling correct) for the best hospitality ever shown to us. They made our trip to IStanbul more than pleasant.Perfect location,clean rooms, fantastic breakfast spread,lovely cakes/cookies freshly everyday and the innumerable cups of turkish coffee makes this place the ideal holiday haven.Must go people ..

This hotel ticks all the boxes for a stay in Istanbul - right in the middle of all the action, reasonably priced, clean and tidy and an extensive breakfast to start the day off. Yusef goes out of his way to make sure that his guests have a great time - he'll tell you what to see, what not to bother with, how to get around and how to get the best deals on visiting the sights and using Istanbul's seriously good public transport system.

Firstly a HUGE thank you to the many (previous) reviewers who took the time out to post reviews. I did some research when planning for my holiday to Istanbul and after reading your positive reviews; decided to go with World Heritage Hotel. They offer an array of complimentary sumptuous cakes and melt in the mouth biscuits with beverage at reception (as standard!) which is a lovely gesture and much appreciated after a long day of touring/sightseeing, this in addition to a great breakfast selection of bread, jam, cereal, pastries, omelettes, savoury Turkish egg/cheese pancakes, cold meats, sausages etc. They also have a minibar which is replenished each and every day with a selection of drinks and water (my children were in drinks heaven!). House keeping is also carried out very well, good quality bed/VERY comfortable mattresses with linen to complement the tasteful furnishing too; bedsheets/duvet/pillow cases changed everyday (as well as slippers) and toiletries generously replenished too. There is wi-fi too which is great for keeping in contact digitally. It is situated at a prime location, minutes away (walking distance!) from all the famous landmarks such as Blue Mosque, Hippodrome, Hagia Sophia etc therefore being cost effective as you will save money on transport (as we did!). Secondly, the customer service is EXCELLENT - from the moment we arrived, we felt looked after. They were very attentive, caring and extremely helpful as well as fostering a very warm and friendly atmosphere in general. The team; Manager Yusuf, Supervisor Ebru, Fathi, Yashar, Umit & Co all worked very hard to ensure that we had a comfortable stay - we felt right at home and all felt as though we were all part of an extended family! We stayed for 5 days and their standards were unfaltering, their service faultless. Their local knowledge and insight was invaluable too in arranging our own tours. Everyday; either Yusuf or Ebru would recommend places and actually mark out the journey on maps (which would require a lot of patience as I'm hopeless with maps!), they have handy which made visiting places just that much more easier; in fact, the only thing they didn't do is accompany us to the trip (for obvious reasons!). Both my children thoroughly enjoyed their stay too, so much so - they didn't want to leave! You will not be disappointed as we weren't nor the many others. Yusuf/Ebru - many many thanks from the Rahim family, we'll definitely be staying at your hotel if we visit Istanbul again.

From the time we checked into this hotel to the departure, the staff couldn't have been more helpful and friendly. They truly made us feel welcomed. We love the location which is so close to everything, to all the sight seeings, tons of good restaurants around all within easy walking distance. Room is fairly good size and very clean. Bed was comfortable, room has nice decor. Only complaint is the bathroom size being so small. Breakfast was pretty good which was included with the room. They serve afternoon tea/coffee with sweets in the lobby which is a very nice gesture. The thing really stands out with this hotel is that everyone from the front desk to the bellboy is so hospitable. It was such a pleasant stay! Room Tip: Room in the back facing the courtyard is quiet. See more room tips

We thoroughly enjoyed our two nights at The World Heritage hotel. Yusuf is a wonderful host so helpful and friendly, he was always prepared to spend time with you helping you plan your sightseeing for the day or helping out with any problems you may have. The staff were all really nice and friendly. The hotel was in an excellent position close to the tram, shops, restaurant, Grand Bazaar etc Yusuf supplied free drinks in the fridge in the room plus tea and homemade cakes which were available in the reception area and were delicious. The morning we had to leave for the airport before breakfast, Yusuf arranged for us to be given an early breakfast which was very nice. A lovely place to stay, I can recommend it highly.

I liked everything about the hotel everything was fantastic, the staff could be more friendly, but nothing that estragsse me to stay. The rooms are superb. Everyone should visit this hotel to be happier people

We stayed at World Heritage Hotel Istanbul because of the reviews on trip advisor, and yes they are true - Yusuf and his team could not have been more helpful and genuinely hospitable. This is not a 5 star hotel with a pool and gym its a comfortable quirky small hotel in a great central location - 5 minutes or less to the Blue Mosque - World Heritage is a hotel you want to shout about and one you will want to return to.

My wife and I enjoyed a fabulous stay at the World Heritage Hotel, Sultanahmet, Istanbul. This is a charming boutique hotel in a great location, within a short walk from the all the attractions, shops and restaurants in the old town. The service could not have been better, the staff were very welcoming and helpful and, as others have pointed out, there is always a selection of coffee and cakes available. The hotel is also excellent value for money, you could easily pay a lot more for a hotel which is not nearly as good as the WHH. We have already recommended this hotel to friends who are thinking of visiting Istanbul.

This hotel was a great choice. Attentive and kind staff, they will offer you a cup of tea or coffee and cake everyday when you arrive from your sightseeing. Yusuf (at the reception) will take 30 minutes and explain you important things for your visit on your arrival, recommending restaurants and things to do or not to do. We followed his recommendations and everything was just great. Breakfast was very good. They will have cold soft drinks at your minibar everyday for free!

I know I'm not adding anything the others before me haven't said, but this place is truly excellent. We travel a lot, and I think I'm pretty good at finding hotels that have great locations, good value, and other important intangibles. This hotel is everything we ever could have asked for! As others have pointed out, Yusef is wonderful. And so is his staff. He is jovial, knowledgable, flexible, and he truly cares about your visit. Everyone we interacted with at the hotel really, really wanted you to love your stay there, and that's something I have yet to find in even the nicest (in terms of star ratings) hotels I've been to. As others have mentioned, he will give you maps, and outline an itinerary for you that he thinks will allow you to make the best of your stay in Istanbul. He's very knowledgable about how to get around, and offers up little shortcuts here and there to make your life easier. The hotel itself is fantastic. It is a two minute walk from the Sultanahmet tram station, which will get you basically anywhere you need to go. While it is in walking distance from most of the major attractions, it also somehow isn't in the middle of the really touristy part of the old city, which saves you from being accosted by every store and restaurant owner when you're ready to wrap up your night. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the room clean and modern. From the pictures, I thought the bathroom was a little kitchy (with the gold trim and all), but when you see it in person, you see that's it's a very thoughtfully put together accommodation. The free minibar is amazing, because elsewhere on our trip throughout Turkey and Greece, water was expensive and not easy to come by. The breakfasts are fantastic. There is no reason to have the wide selection they have - and yet they do! And they'll make you an omelette if you really want one, but just trust me and eat the menemen or cheese pie. Every afternoon or evening, when you're coming in for a recharge or to rest up for the next day, there is complimentary Turkish Tea and cakes. More often than not, they would rather make the tea for you so you can relax. And it is all very, very tasty. In additional to all of that (and I think that's enough!), at one point in our stay, there was a child just screaming in the hotel. It was during the day, not a big deal, but as we were heading out I mentioned that someone had a really unhappy child to Yusef.

I know I'm not adding anything the others before me haven't said, but this place is truly excellent. We travel a lot, and I think I'm pretty good at finding hotels that have great locations, good value, and other important intangibles. This hotel is everything we ever could have asked for! As others have pointed out, Yusef is wonderful. And so is his staff. He is jovial, knowledgable, flexible, and he truly cares about your visit. Everyone we interacted with at the hotel really, really wanted you to love your stay there, and that's something I have yet to find in even the nicest (in terms of star ratings) hotels I've been to. As others have mentioned, he will give you maps, and outline an itinerary for you that he thinks will allow you to make the best of your stay in Istanbul. He's very knowledgable about how to get around, and offers up little shortcuts here and there to make your life easier. The hotel itself is fantastic. It is a two minute walk from the Sultanahmet tram station, which will get you basically anywhere you need to go. While it is in walking distance from most of the major attractions, it also somehow isn't in the middle of the really touristy part of the old city, which saves you from being accosted by every store and restaurant owner when you're ready to wrap up your night. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the room clean and modern. From the pictures, I thought the bathroom was a little kitchy (with the gold trim and all), but when you see it in person, you see that's it's a very thoughtfully put together accommodation. The free minibar is amazing, because elsewhere on our trip throughout Turkey and Greece, water was expensive and not easy to come by. The breakfasts are fantastic. There is no reason to have the wide selection they have - and yet they do! And they'll make you an omelette if you really want one, but just trust me and eat the menemen or cheese pie. Every afternoon or evening, when you're coming in for a recharge or to rest up for the next day, there is complimentary Turkish Tea and cakes. More often than not, they would rather make the tea for you so you can relax. And it is all very, very tasty. In additional to all of that (and I think that's enough!), at one point in our stay, there was a child just screaming in the hotel. It was during the day, not a big deal, but as we were heading out I mentioned that someone had a really unhappy child to Yusef. He explained to me that the family of five was just spending a few hours in that room until they could catch their plane. Their flight into Istanbul had been severely delayed, and it was thunderstorming outside, so the family was just looking for a place to spend a few hours to dry off and warm up until it was time to go back to the airport. Yusef let them have the room for a while, and for next to no money, after other hotels had told them they would have to pay for a full night. That's the kind of guy I want to give my business to.

Many many thanks to Yousuf, Ebru and Omit( hope i got his spelling correct) for the best hospitality ever shown to us. They made our trip to IStanbul more than pleasant.Perfect location,clean rooms, fantastic breakfast spread,lovely cakes/cookies freshly everyday and the innumerable cups of turkish coffee makes this place the ideal holiday haven.Must go people ..

This hotel ticks all the boxes for a stay in Istanbul - right in the middle of all the action, reasonably priced, clean and tidy and an extensive breakfast to start the day off. Yusef goes out of his way to make sure that his guests have a great time - he'll tell you what to see, what not to bother with, how to get around and how to get the best deals on visiting the sights and using Istanbul's seriously good public transport system.

Firstly a HUGE thank you to the many (previous) reviewers who took the time out to post reviews. I did some research when planning for my holiday to Istanbul and after reading your positive reviews; decided to go with World Heritage Hotel. They offer an array of complimentary sumptuous cakes and melt in the mouth biscuits with beverage at reception (as standard!) which is a lovely gesture and much appreciated after a long day of touring/sightseeing, this in addition to a great breakfast selection of bread, jam, cereal, pastries, omelettes, savoury Turkish egg/cheese pancakes, cold meats, sausages etc. They also have a minibar which is replenished each and every day with a selection of drinks and water (my children were in drinks heaven!). House keeping is also carried out very well, good quality bed/VERY comfortable mattresses with linen to complement the tasteful furnishing too; bedsheets/duvet/pillow cases changed everyday (as well as slippers) and toiletries generously replenished too. There is wi-fi too which is great for keeping in contact digitally. It is situated at a prime location, minutes away (walking distance!) from all the famous landmarks such as Blue Mosque, Hippodrome, Hagia Sophia etc therefore being cost effective as you will save money on transport (as we did!). Secondly, the customer service is EXCELLENT - from the moment we arrived, we felt looked after. They were very attentive, caring and extremely helpful as well as fostering a very warm and friendly atmosphere in general. The team; Manager Yusuf, Supervisor Ebru, Fathi, Yashar, Umit & Co all worked very hard to ensure that we had a comfortable stay - we felt right at home and all felt as though we were all part of an extended family! We stayed for 5 days and their standards were unfaltering, their service faultless. Their local knowledge and insight was invaluable too in arranging our own tours. Everyday; either Yusuf or Ebru would recommend places and actually mark out the journey on maps (which would require a lot of patience as I'm hopeless with maps!), they have handy which made visiting places just that much more easier; in fact, the only thing they didn't do is accompany us to the trip (for obvious reasons!). Both my children thoroughly enjoyed their stay too, so much so - they didn't want to leave! You will not be disappointed as we weren't nor the many others. Yusuf/Ebru - many many thanks from the Rahim family, we'll definitely be staying at your hotel if we visit Istanbul again.

From the time we checked into this hotel to the departure, the staff couldn't have been more helpful and friendly. They truly made us feel welcomed. We love the location which is so close to everything, to all the sight seeings, tons of good restaurants around all within easy walking distance. Room is fairly good size and very clean. Bed was comfortable, room has nice decor. Only complaint is the bathroom size being so small. Breakfast was pretty good which was included with the room. They serve afternoon tea/coffee with sweets in the lobby which is a very nice gesture. The thing really stands out with this hotel is that everyone from the front desk to the bellboy is so hospitable. It was such a pleasant stay! Room Tip: Room in the back facing the courtyard is quiet. See more room tips

We thoroughly enjoyed our two nights at The World Heritage hotel. Yusuf is a wonderful host so helpful and friendly, he was always prepared to spend time with you helping you plan your sightseeing for the day or helping out with any problems you may have. The staff were all really nice and friendly. The hotel was in an excellent position close to the tram, shops, restaurant, Grand Bazaar etc Yusuf supplied free drinks in the fridge in the room plus tea and homemade cakes which were available in the reception area and were delicious. The morning we had to leave for the airport before breakfast, Yusuf arranged for us to be given an early breakfast which was very nice. A lovely place to stay, I can recommend it highly.

I liked everything about the hotel everything was fantastic, the staff could be more friendly, but nothing that estragsse me to stay. The rooms are superb. Everyone should visit this hotel to be happier people

We stayed at World Heritage Hotel Istanbul because of the reviews on trip advisor, and yes they are true - Yusuf and his team could not have been more helpful and genuinely hospitable. This is not a 5 star hotel with a pool and gym its a comfortable quirky small hotel in a great central location - 5 minutes or less to the Blue Mosque - World Heritage is a hotel you want to shout about and one you will want to return to.

My wife and I enjoyed a fabulous stay at the World Heritage Hotel, Sultanahmet, Istanbul. This is a charming boutique hotel in a great location, within a short walk from the all the attractions, shops and restaurants in the old town. The service could not have been better, the staff were very welcoming and helpful and, as others have pointed out, there is always a selection of coffee and cakes available. The hotel is also excellent value for money, you could easily pay a lot more for a hotel which is not nearly as good as the WHH. We have already recommended this hotel to friends who are thinking of visiting Istanbul.

This hotel was a great choice. Attentive and kind staff, they will offer you a cup of tea or coffee and cake everyday when you arrive from your sightseeing. Yusuf (at the reception) will take 30 minutes and explain you important things for your visit on your arrival, recommending restaurants and things to do or not to do.

The thing really stands out with this hotel is that everyone from the front desk to the bellboy is so hospitable. It was such a pleasant stay! Room Tip: Room in the back facing the courtyard is quiet. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights on our honeymoon and we were very impressed. From the moment we arrived in Istanbul, we felt very taken care of by World Heritage Hotel. They have pick-up service from the airport, and the moment you walk in they greet you with smiles and tell you how to get to the big tourist places, great places to eat, etc. They always have coffee and tea available as well as some yummy snacks available in the lobby as well. The rooms are small but very charming and comfortable, and they were always clean. The service is what really made this hotel spectacular. Every time you come or go, they always greet you with a smile and make sure you know where you are going or they help with suggestions. They are very genuine in their service- something we really appreciated. The buffet breakfast in the morning is delicious and they even make personal omelets for you! If we ever return to Istanbul, we would stay here again and we highly recommend it to anyone going to Istanbul!

We thoroughly enjoyed our two nights at The World Heritage hotel. Yusuf is a wonderful host so helpful and friendly, he was always prepared to spend time with you helping you plan your sightseeing for the day or helping out with any problems you may have. The staff were all really nice and friendly. The hotel was in an excellent position close to the tram, shops, restaurant, Grand Bazaar etc Yusuf supplied free drinks in the fridge in the room plus tea and homemade cakes which were available in the reception area and were delicious. The morning we had to leave for the airport before breakfast, Yusuf arranged for us to be given an early breakfast which was very nice. A lovely place to stay, I can recommend it highly.

I liked everything about the hotel everything was fantastic, the staff could be more friendly, but nothing that estragsse me to stay. The rooms are superb. Everyone should visit this hotel to be happier people

We stayed at World Heritage Hotel Istanbul because of the reviews on trip advisor, and yes they are true - Yusuf and his team could not have been more helpful and genuinely hospitable. This is not a 5 star hotel with a pool and gym its a comfortable quirky small hotel in a great central location - 5 minutes or less to the Blue Mosque - World Heritage is a hotel you want to shout about and one you will want to return to.

My wife and I enjoyed a fabulous stay at the World Heritage Hotel, Sultanahmet, Istanbul. This is a charming boutique hotel in a great location, within a short walk from the all the attractions, shops and restaurants in the old town. The service could not have been better, the staff were very welcoming and helpful and, as others have pointed out, there is always a selection of coffee and cakes available. The hotel is also excellent value for money, you could easily pay a lot more for a hotel which is not nearly as good as the WHH. We have already recommended this hotel to friends who are thinking of visiting Istanbul.

This hotel was a great choice. Attentive and kind staff, they will offer you a cup of tea or coffee and cake everyday when you arrive from your sightseeing. Yusuf (at the reception) will take 30 minutes and explain you important things for your visit on your arrival, recommending restaurants and things to do or not to do. We followed his recommendations and everything was just great. Breakfast was very good. They will have cold soft drinks at your minibar everyday for free!

I know I'm not adding anything the others before me haven't said, but this place is truly excellent. We travel a lot, and I think I'm pretty good at finding hotels that have great locations, good value, and other important intangibles. This hotel is everything we ever could have asked for! As others have pointed out, Yusef is wonderful. And so is his staff. He is jovial, knowledgable, flexible, and he truly cares about your visit. Everyone we interacted with at the hotel really, really wanted you to love your stay there, and that's something I have yet to find in even the nicest (in terms of star ratings) hotels I've been to. As others have mentioned, he will give you maps, and outline an itinerary for you that he thinks will allow you to make the best of your stay in Istanbul. He's very knowledgable about how to get around, and offers up little shortcuts here and there to make your life easier. The hotel itself is fantastic. It is a two minute walk from the Sultanahmet tram station, which will get you basically anywhere you need to go. While it is in walking distance from most of the major attractions, it also somehow isn't in the middle of the really touristy part of the old city, which saves you from being accosted by every store and restaurant owner when you're ready to wrap up your night. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the room clean and modern. From the pictures, I thought the bathroom was a little kitchy (with the gold trim and all), but when you see it in person, you see that's it's a very thoughtfully put together accommodation. The free minibar is amazing, because elsewhere on our trip throughout Turkey and Greece, water was expensive and not easy to come by. The breakfasts are fantastic. There is no reason to have the wide selection they have - and yet they do! And they'll make you an omelette if you really want one, but just trust me and eat the menemen or cheese pie. Every afternoon or evening, when you're coming in for a recharge or to rest up for the next day, there is complimentary Turkish Tea and cakes. More often than not, they would rather make the tea for you so you can relax. And it is all very, very tasty. In additional to all of that (and I think that's enough!), at one point in our stay, there was a child just screaming in the hotel. It was during the day, not a big deal, but as we were heading out I mentioned that someone had a really unhappy child to Yusef. He explained to me that the family of five was just spending a few hours in that room until they could catch their plane. Their flight into Istanbul had been severely delayed, and it was thunderstorming outside, so the family was just looking for a place to spend a few hours to dry off and warm up until it was time to go back to the airport. Yusef let them have the room for a while, and for next to no money, after other hotels had told them they would have to pay for a full night. That's the kind of guy I want to give my business to. Room Tip: I don't think there's a bad room at this hotel, but the rooms at the back of the hotel seem... See more room tips

Many many thanks to Yousuf, Ebru and Omit( hope i got his spelling correct) for the best hospitality ever shown to us. They made our trip to IStanbul more than pleasant.Perfect location,clean rooms, fantastic breakfast spread,lovely cakes/cookies freshly everyday and the innumerable cups of turkish coffee makes this place the ideal holiday haven.Must go people ..

This hotel ticks all the boxes for a stay in Istanbul - right in the middle of all the action, reasonably priced, clean and tidy and an extensive breakfast to start the day off. Yusef goes out of his way to make sure that his guests have a great time - he'll tell you what to see, what not to bother with, how to get around and how to get the best deals on visiting the sights and using Istanbul's seriously good public transport system.

Firstly a HUGE thank you to the many (previous) reviewers who took the time out to post reviews. I did some research when planning for my holiday to Istanbul and after reading your positive reviews; decided to go with World Heritage Hotel. They offer an array of complimentary sumptuous cakes and melt in the mouth biscuits with beverage at reception (as standard!) which is a lovely gesture and much appreciated after a long day of touring/sightseeing, this in addition to a great breakfast selection of bread, jam, cereal, pastries, omelettes, savoury Turkish egg/cheese pancakes, cold meats, sausages etc. They also have a minibar which is replenished each and every day with a selection of drinks and water (my children were in drinks heaven!). House keeping is also carried out very well, good quality bed/VERY comfortable mattresses with linen to complement the tasteful furnishing too; bedsheets/duvet/pillow cases changed everyday (as well as slippers) and toiletries generously replenished too. There is wi-fi too which is great for keeping in contact digitally. It is situated at a prime location, minutes away (walking distance!) from all the famous landmarks such as Blue Mosque, Hippodrome, Hagia Sophia etc therefore being cost effective as you will save money on transport (as we did!). Secondly, the customer service is EXCELLENT - from the moment we arrived, we felt looked after. They were very attentive, caring and extremely helpful as well as fostering a very warm and friendly atmosphere in general. The team; Manager Yusuf, Supervisor Ebru, Fathi, Yashar, Umit & Co all worked very hard to ensure that we had a comfortable stay - we felt right at home and all felt as though we were all part of an extended family! We stayed for 5 days and their standards were unfaltering, their service faultless. Their local knowledge and insight was invaluable too in arranging our own tours. Everyday; either Yusuf or Ebru would recommend places and actually mark out the journey on maps (which would require a lot of patience as I'm hopeless with maps!), they have handy which made visiting places just that much more easier; in fact, the only thing they didn't do is accompany us to the trip (for obvious reasons!). Both my children thoroughly enjoyed their stay too, so much so - they didn't want to leave! You will not be disappointed as we weren't nor the many others. Yusuf/Ebru - many many thanks from the Rahim family, we'll definitely be staying at your hotel if we visit Istanbul again.

Yusef let them have the room for a while, and for next to no money, after other hotels had told them they would have to pay for a full night. That's the kind of guy I want to give my business to.

Many many thanks to Yousuf, Ebru and Omit( hope i got his spelling correct) for the best hospitality ever shown to us. They made our trip to IStanbul more than pleasant.Perfect location,clean rooms, fantastic breakfast spread,lovely cakes/cookies freshly everyday and the innumerable cups of turkish coffee makes this place the ideal holiday haven.Must go people ..

This hotel ticks all the boxes for a stay in Istanbul - right in the middle of all the action, reasonably priced, clean and tidy and an extensive breakfast to start the day off. Yusef goes out of his way to make sure that his guests have a great time - he'll tell you what to see, what not to bother with, how to get around and how to get the best deals on visiting the sights and using Istanbul's seriously good public transport system.

Firstly a HUGE thank you to the many (previous) reviewers who took the time out to post reviews. I did some research when planning for my holiday to Istanbul and after reading your positive reviews; decided to go with World Heritage Hotel. They offer an array of complimentary sumptuous cakes and melt in the mouth biscuits with beverage at reception (as standard!) which is a lovely gesture and much appreciated after a long day of touring/sightseeing, this in addition to a great breakfast selection of bread, jam, cereal, pastries, omelettes, savoury Turkish egg/cheese pancakes, cold meats, sausages etc. They also have a minibar which is replenished each and every day with a selection of drinks and water (my children were in drinks heaven!). House keeping is also carried out very well, good quality bed/VERY comfortable mattresses with linen to complement the tasteful furnishing too; bedsheets/duvet/pillow cases changed everyday (as well as slippers) and toiletries generously replenished too. There is wi-fi too which is great for keeping in contact digitally. It is situated at a prime location, minutes away (walking distance!) from all the famous landmarks such as Blue Mosque, Hippodrome, Hagia Sophia etc therefore being cost effective as you will save money on transport (as we did!). Secondly, the customer service is EXCELLENT - from the moment we arrived, we felt looked after. They were very attentive, caring and extremely helpful as well as fostering a very warm and friendly atmosphere in general. The team; Manager Yusuf, Supervisor Ebru, Fathi, Yashar, Umit & Co all worked very hard to ensure that we had a comfortable stay - we felt right at home and all felt as though we were all part of an extended family! We stayed for 5 days and their standards were unfaltering, their service faultless. Their local knowledge and insight was invaluable too in arranging our own tours. Everyday; either Yusuf or Ebru would recommend places and actually mark out the journey on maps (which would require a lot of patience as I'm hopeless with maps!), they have handy which made visiting places just that much more easier; in fact, the only thing they didn't do is accompany us to the trip (for obvious reasons!). Both my children thoroughly enjoyed their stay too, so much so - they didn't want to leave! You will not be disappointed as we weren't nor the many others. Yusuf/Ebru - many many thanks from the Rahim family, we'll definitely be staying at your hotel if we visit Istanbul again.

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights on our honeymoon and we were very impressed. From the moment we arrived in Istanbul, we felt very taken care of by World Heritage Hotel. They have pick-up service from the airport, and the moment you walk in they greet you with smiles and tell you how to get to the big tourist places, great places to eat, etc. They always have coffee and tea available as well as some yummy snacks available in the lobby as well. The rooms are small but very charming and comfortable, and they were always clean. The service is what really made this hotel spectacular. Every time you come or go, they always greet you with a smile and make sure you know where you are going or they help with suggestions. They are very genuine in their service- something we really appreciated. The buffet breakfast in the morning is delicious and they even make personal omelets for you! If we ever return to Istanbul, we would stay here again and we highly recommend it to anyone going to Istanbul!

We thoroughly enjoyed our two nights at The World Heritage hotel. Yusuf is a wonderful host so helpful and friendly, he was always prepared to spend time with you helping you plan your sightseeing for the day or helping out with any problems you may have. The staff were all really nice and friendly. The hotel was in an excellent position close to the tram, shops, restaurant, Grand Bazaar etc Yusuf supplied free drinks in the fridge in the room plus tea and homemade cakes which were available in the reception area and were delicious. The morning we had to leave for the airport before breakfast, Yusuf arranged for us to be given an early breakfast which was very nice. A lovely place to stay, I can recommend it highly.

I liked everything about the hotel everything was fantastic, the staff could be more friendly, but nothing that estragsse me to stay. The rooms are superb. Everyone should visit this hotel to be happier people

We stayed at World Heritage Hotel Istanbul because of the reviews on trip advisor, and yes they are true - Yusuf and his team could not have been more helpful and genuinely hospitable. This is not a 5 star hotel with a pool and gym its a comfortable quirky small hotel in a great central location - 5 minutes or less to the Blue Mosque - World Heritage is a hotel you want to shout about and one you will want to return to.

My wife and I enjoyed a fabulous stay at the World Heritage Hotel, Sultanahmet, Istanbul. This is a charming boutique hotel in a great location, within a short walk from the all the attractions, shops and restaurants in the old town. The service could not have been better, the staff were very welcoming and helpful and, as others have pointed out, there is always a selection of coffee and cakes available. The hotel is also excellent value for money, you could easily pay a lot more for a hotel which is not nearly as good as the WHH. We have already recommended this hotel to friends who are thinking of visiting Istanbul.

This hotel was a great choice. Attentive and kind staff, they will offer you a cup of tea or coffee and cake everyday when you arrive from your sightseeing. Yusuf (at the reception) will take 30 minutes and explain you important things for your visit on your arrival, recommending restaurants and things to do or not to do. We followed his recommendations and everything was just great. Breakfast was very good. They will have cold soft drinks at your minibar everyday for free!

I know I'm not adding anything the others before me haven't said, but this place is truly excellent. We travel a lot, and I think I'm pretty good at finding hotels that have great locations, good value, and other important intangibles. This hotel is everything we ever could have asked for! As others have pointed out, Yusef is wonderful. And so is his staff. He is jovial, knowledgable, flexible, and he truly cares about your visit. Everyone we interacted with at the hotel really, really wanted you to love your stay there, and that's something I have yet to find in even the nicest (in terms of star ratings) hotels I've been to. As others have mentioned, he will give you maps, and outline an itinerary for you that he thinks will allow you to make the best of your stay in Istanbul. He's very knowledgable about how to get around, and offers up little shortcuts here and there to make your life easier. The hotel itself is fantastic. It is a two minute walk from the Sultanahmet tram station, which will get you basically anywhere you need to go. While it is in walking distance from most of the major attractions, it also somehow isn't in the middle of the really touristy part of the old city, which saves you from being accosted by every store and restaurant owner when you're ready to wrap up your night. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the room clean and modern. From the pictures, I thought the bathroom was a little kitchy (with the gold trim and all), but when you see it in person, you see that's it's a very thoughtfully put together accommodation. The free minibar is amazing, because elsewhere on our trip throughout Turkey and Greece, water was expensive and not easy to come by. The breakfasts are fantastic. There is no reason to have the wide selection they have - and yet they do! And they'll make you an omelette if you really want one, but just trust me and eat the menemen or cheese pie. Every afternoon or evening, when you're coming in for a recharge or to rest up for the next day, there is complimentary Turkish Tea and cakes. More often than not, they would rather make the tea for you so you can relax. And it is all very, very tasty. In additional to all of that (and I think that's enough!), at one point in our stay, there was a child just screaming in the hotel. It was during the day, not a big deal, but as we were heading out I mentioned that someone had a really unhappy child to Yusef. He explained to me that the family of five was just spending a few hours in that room until they could catch their plane. Their flight into Istanbul had been severely delayed, and it was thunderstorming outside, so the family was just looking for a place to spend a few hours to dry off and warm up until it was time to go back to the airport. Yusef let them have the room for a while, and for next to no money, after other hotels had told them they would have to pay for a full night. That's the kind of guy I want to give my business to.

This hotel was a great choice. Attentive and kind staff, they will offer you a cup of tea or coffee and cake everyday when you arrive from your sightseeing. Yusuf (at the reception) will take 30 minutes and explain you important things for your visit on your arrival, recommending restaurants and things to do or not to do. We followed his recommendations and everything was just great. Breakfast was very good. They will have cold soft drinks at your minibar everyday for free!

I know I'm not adding anything the others before me haven't said, but this place is truly excellent. We travel a lot, and I think I'm pretty good at finding hotels that have great locations, good value, and other important intangibles. This hotel is everything we ever could have asked for! As others have pointed out, Yusef is wonderful. And so is his staff. He is jovial, knowledgable, flexible, and he truly cares about your visit. Everyone we interacted with at the hotel really, really wanted you to love your stay there, and that's something I have yet to find in even the nicest (in terms of star ratings) hotels I've been to. As others have mentioned, he will give you maps, and outline an itinerary for you that he thinks will allow you to make the best of your stay in Istanbul. He's very knowledgable about how to get around, and offers up little shortcuts here and there to make your life easier. The hotel itself is fantastic. It is a two minute walk from the Sultanahmet tram station, which will get you basically anywhere you need to go. While it is in walking distance from most of the major attractions, it also somehow isn't in the middle of the really touristy part of the old city, which saves you from being accosted by every store and restaurant owner when you're ready to wrap up your night. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the room clean and modern. From the pictures, I thought the bathroom was a little kitchy (with the gold trim and all), but when you see it in person, you see that's it's a very thoughtfully put together accommodation. The free minibar is amazing, because elsewhere on our trip throughout Turkey and Greece, water was expensive and not easy to come by. The breakfasts are fantastic. There is no reason to have the wide selection they have - and yet they do! And they'll make you an omelette if you really want one, but just trust me and eat the menemen or cheese pie. Every afternoon or evening, when you're coming in for a recharge or to rest up for the next day, there is complimentary Turkish Tea and cakes. More often than not, they would rather make the tea for you so you can relax. And it is all very, very tasty. In additional to all of that (and I think that's enough!), at one point in our stay, there was a child just screaming in the hotel. It was during the day, not a big deal, but as we were heading out I mentioned that someone had a really unhappy child to Yusef. He explained to me that the family of five was just spending a few hours in that room until they could catch their plane. Their flight into Istanbul had been severely delayed, and it was thunderstorming outside, so the family was just looking for a place to spend a few hours to dry off and warm up until it was time to go back to the airport. Yusef let them have the room for a while, and for next to no money, after other hotels had told them they would have to pay for a full night. That's the kind of guy I want to give my business to.

Many many thanks to Yousuf, Ebru and Omit( hope i got his spelling correct) for the best hospitality ever shown to us. They made our trip to IStanbul more than pleasant.Perfect location,clean rooms, fantastic breakfast spread,lovely cakes/cookies freshly everyday and the innumerable cups of turkish coffee makes this place the ideal holiday haven.Must go people ..

This hotel ticks all the boxes for a stay in Istanbul - right in the middle of all the action, reasonably priced, clean and tidy and an extensive breakfast to start the day off. Yusef goes out of his way to make sure that his guests have a great time - he'll tell you what to see, what not to bother with, how to get around and how to get the best deals on visiting the sights and using Istanbul's seriously good public transport system.

Firstly a HUGE thank you to the many (previous) reviewers who took the time out to post reviews. I did some research when planning for my holiday to Istanbul and after reading your positive reviews; decided to go with World Heritage Hotel. They offer an array of complimentary sumptuous cakes and melt in the mouth biscuits with beverage at reception (as standard!) which is a lovely gesture and much appreciated after a long day of touring/sightseeing, this in addition to a great breakfast selection of bread, jam, cereal, pastries, omelettes, savoury Turkish egg/cheese pancakes, cold meats, sausages etc. They also have a minibar which is replenished each and every day with a selection of drinks and water (my children were in drinks heaven!). House keeping is also carried out very well, good quality bed/VERY comfortable mattresses with linen to complement the tasteful furnishing too; bedsheets/duvet/pillow cases changed everyday (as well as slippers) and toiletries generously replenished too. There is wi-fi too which is great for keeping in contact digitally. It is situated at a prime location, minutes away (walking distance!) from all the famous landmarks such as Blue Mosque, Hippodrome, Hagia Sophia etc therefore being cost effective as you will save money on transport (as we did!). Secondly, the customer service is EXCELLENT - from the moment we arrived, we felt looked after. They were very attentive, caring and extremely helpful as well as fostering a very warm and friendly atmosphere in general. The team; Manager Yusuf, Supervisor Ebru, Fathi, Yashar, Umit & Co all worked very hard to ensure that we had a comfortable stay - we felt right at home and all felt as though we were all part of an extended family! We stayed for 5 days and their standards were unfaltering, their service faultless. Their local knowledge and insight was invaluable too in arranging our own tours. Everyday; either Yusuf or Ebru would recommend places and actually mark out the journey on maps (which would require a lot of patience as I'm hopeless with maps!), they have handy which made visiting places just that much more easier; in fact, the only thing they didn't do is accompany us to the trip (for obvious reasons!). Both my children thoroughly enjoyed their stay too, so much so - they didn't want to leave! You will not be disappointed as we weren't nor the many others. Yusuf/Ebru - many many thanks from the Rahim family, we'll definitely be staying at your hotel if we visit Istanbul again.

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights on our honeymoon and we were very impressed. From the moment we arrived in Istanbul, we felt very taken care of by World Heritage Hotel. They have pick-up service from the airport, and the moment you walk in they greet you with smiles and tell you how to get to the big tourist places, great places to eat, etc. They always have coffee and tea available as well as some yummy snacks available in the lobby as well. The rooms are small but very charming and comfortable, and they were always clean. The service is what really made this hotel spectacular. Every time you come or go, they always greet you with a smile and make sure you know where you are going or they help with suggestions. They are very genuine in their service- something we really appreciated. The buffet breakfast in the morning is delicious and they even make personal omelets for you! If we ever return to Istanbul, we would stay here again and we highly recommend it to anyone going to Istanbul!

We thoroughly enjoyed our two nights at The World Heritage hotel. Yusuf is a wonderful host so helpful and friendly, he was always prepared to spend time with you helping you plan your sightseeing for the day or helping out with any problems you may have. The staff were all really nice and friendly. The hotel was in an excellent position close to the tram, shops, restaurant, Grand Bazaar etc Yusuf supplied free drinks in the fridge in the room plus tea and homemade cakes which were available in the reception area and were delicious. The morning we had to leave for the airport before breakfast, Yusuf arranged for us to be given an early breakfast which was very nice. A lovely place to stay, I can recommend it highly.

I liked everything about the hotel everything was fantastic, the staff could be more friendly, but nothing that estragsse me to stay. The rooms are superb. Everyone should visit this hotel to be happier people

We stayed at World Heritage Hotel Istanbul because of the reviews on trip advisor, and yes they are true - Yusuf and his team could not have been more helpful and genuinely hospitable. This is not a 5 star hotel with a pool and gym its a comfortable quirky small hotel in a great central location - 5 minutes or less to the Blue Mosque - World Heritage is a hotel you want to shout about and one you will want to return to.

My wife and I enjoyed a fabulous stay at the World Heritage Hotel, Sultanahmet, Istanbul. This is a charming boutique hotel in a great location, within a short walk from the all the attractions, shops and restaurants in the old town. The service could not have been better, the staff were very welcoming and helpful and, as others have pointed out, there is always a selection of coffee and cakes available.

Everyday; either Yusuf or Ebru would recommend places and actually mark out the journey on maps (which would require a lot of patience as I'm hopeless with maps!), they have handy which made visiting places just that much more easier; in fact, the only thing they didn't do is accompany us to the trip (for obvious reasons!). Both my children thoroughly enjoyed their stay too, so much so - they didn't want to leave! You will not be disappointed as we weren't nor the many others. Yusuf/Ebru - many many thanks from the Rahim family, we'll definitely be staying at your hotel if we visit Istanbul again.

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights on our honeymoon and we were very impressed. From the moment we arrived in Istanbul, we felt very taken care of by World Heritage Hotel. They have pick-up service from the airport, and the moment you walk in they greet you with smiles and tell you how to get to the big tourist places, great places to eat, etc. They always have coffee and tea available as well as some yummy snacks available in the lobby as well. The rooms are small but very charming and comfortable, and they were always clean. The service is what really made this hotel spectacular. Every time you come or go, they always greet you with a smile and make sure you know where you are going or they help with suggestions. They are very genuine in their service- something we really appreciated. The buffet breakfast in the morning is delicious and they even make personal omelets for you! If we ever return to Istanbul, we would stay here again and we highly recommend it to anyone going to Istanbul!

We thoroughly enjoyed our two nights at The World Heritage hotel. Yusuf is a wonderful host so helpful and friendly, he was always prepared to spend time with you helping you plan your sightseeing for the day or helping out with any problems you may have. The staff were all really nice and friendly. The hotel was in an excellent position close to the tram, shops, restaurant, Grand Bazaar etc Yusuf supplied free drinks in the fridge in the room plus tea and homemade cakes which were available in the reception area and were delicious. The morning we had to leave for the airport before breakfast, Yusuf arranged for us to be given an early breakfast which was very nice. A lovely place to stay, I can recommend it highly.

I liked everything about the hotel everything was fantastic, the staff could be more friendly, but nothing that estragsse me to stay. The rooms are superb. Everyone should visit this hotel to be happier people

We stayed at World Heritage Hotel Istanbul because of the reviews on trip advisor, and yes they are true - Yusuf and his team could not have been more helpful and genuinely hospitable. This is not a 5 star hotel with a pool and gym its a comfortable quirky small hotel in a great central location - 5 minutes or less to the Blue Mosque - World Heritage is a hotel you want to shout about and one you will want to return to.

My wife and I enjoyed a fabulous stay at the World Heritage Hotel, Sultanahmet, Istanbul. This is a charming boutique hotel in a great location, within a short walk from the all the attractions, shops and restaurants in the old town. The service could not have been better, the staff were very welcoming and helpful and, as others have pointed out, there is always a selection of coffee and cakes available. The hotel is also excellent value for money, you could easily pay a lot more for a hotel which is not nearly as good as the WHH. We have already recommended this hotel to friends who are thinking of visiting Istanbul.

This hotel was a great choice. Attentive and kind staff, they will offer you a cup of tea or coffee and cake everyday when you arrive from your sightseeing. Yusuf (at the reception) will take 30 minutes and explain you important things for your visit on your arrival, recommending restaurants and things to do or not to do. We followed his recommendations and everything was just great. Breakfast was very good. They will have cold soft drinks at your minibar everyday for free!

I know I'm not adding anything the others before me haven't said, but this place is truly excellent. We travel a lot, and I think I'm pretty good at finding hotels that have great locations, good value, and other important intangibles. This hotel is everything we ever could have asked for! As others have pointed out, Yusef is wonderful. And so is his staff. He is jovial, knowledgable, flexible, and he truly cares about your visit. Everyone we interacted with at the hotel really, really wanted you to love your stay there, and that's something I have yet to find in even the nicest (in terms of star ratings) hotels I've been to. As others have mentioned, he will give you maps, and outline an itinerary for you that he thinks will allow you to make the best of your stay in Istanbul. He's very knowledgable about how to get around, and offers up little shortcuts here and there to make your life easier. The hotel itself is fantastic. It is a two minute walk from the Sultanahmet tram station, which will get you basically anywhere you need to go. While it is in walking distance from most of the major attractions, it also somehow isn't in the middle of the really touristy part of the old city, which saves you from being accosted by every store and restaurant owner when you're ready to wrap up your night. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the room clean and modern. From the pictures, I thought the bathroom was a little kitchy (with the gold trim and all), but when you see it in person, you see that's it's a very thoughtfully put together accommodation. The free minibar is amazing, because elsewhere on our trip throughout Turkey and Greece, water was expensive and not easy to come by. The breakfasts are fantastic. There is no reason to have the wide selection they have - and yet they do! And they'll make you an omelette if you really want one, but just trust me and eat the menemen or cheese pie. Every afternoon or evening, when you're coming in for a recharge or to rest up for the next day, there is complimentary Turkish Tea and cakes. More often than not, they would rather make the tea for you so you can relax. And it is all very, very tasty. In additional to all of that (and I think that's enough!), at one point in our stay, there was a child just screaming in the hotel. It was during the day, not a big deal, but as we were heading out I mentioned that someone had a really unhappy child to Yusef. He explained to me that the family of five was just spending a few hours in that room until they could catch their plane. Their flight into Istanbul had been severely delayed, and it was thunderstorming outside, so the family was just looking for a place to spend a few hours to dry off and warm up until it was time to go back to the airport. Yusef let them have the room for a while, and for next to no money, after other hotels had told them they would have to pay for a full night. That's the kind of guy I want to give my business to.

Many many thanks to Yousuf, Ebru and Omit( hope i got his spelling correct) for the best hospitality ever shown to us. They made our trip to IStanbul more than pleasant.Perfect location,clean rooms, fantastic breakfast spread,lovely cakes/cookies freshly everyday and the innumerable cups of turkish coffee makes this place the ideal holiday haven.Must go people ..

This hotel ticks all the boxes for a stay in Istanbul - right in the middle of all the action, reasonably priced, clean and tidy and an extensive breakfast to start the day off. Yusef goes out of his way to make sure that his guests have a great time - he'll tell you what to see, what not to bother with, how to get around and how to get the best deals on visiting the sights and using Istanbul's seriously good public transport system.

Firstly a HUGE thank you to the many (previous) reviewers who took the time out to post reviews. I did some research when planning for my holiday to Istanbul and after reading your positive reviews; decided to go with World Heritage Hotel. They offer an array of complimentary sumptuous cakes and melt in the mouth biscuits with beverage at reception (as standard!) which is a lovely gesture and much appreciated after a long day of touring/sightseeing, this in addition to a great breakfast selection of bread, jam, cereal, pastries, omelettes, savoury Turkish egg/cheese pancakes, cold meats, sausages etc. They also have a minibar which is replenished each and every day with a selection of drinks and water (my children were in drinks heaven!). House keeping is also carried out very well, good quality bed/VERY comfortable mattresses with linen to complement the tasteful furnishing too; bedsheets/duvet/pillow cases changed everyday (as well as slippers) and toiletries generously replenished too. There is wi-fi too which is great for keeping in contact digitally. It is situated at a prime location, minutes away (walking distance!) from all the famous landmarks such as Blue Mosque, Hippodrome, Hagia Sophia etc therefore being cost effective as you will save money on transport (as we did!). Secondly, the customer service is EXCELLENT - from the moment we arrived, we felt looked after. They were very attentive, caring and extremely helpful as well as fostering a very warm and friendly atmosphere in general. The team; Manager Yusuf, Supervisor Ebru, Fathi, Yashar, Umit & Co all worked very hard to ensure that we had a comfortable stay - we felt right at home and all felt as though we were all part of an extended family!

It was during the day, not a big deal, but as we were heading out I mentioned that someone had a really unhappy child to Yusef. He explained to me that the family of five was just spending a few hours in that room until they could catch their plane. Their flight into Istanbul had been severely delayed, and it was thunderstorming outside, so the family was just looking for a place to spend a few hours to dry off and warm up until it was time to go back to the airport. Yusef let them have the room for a while, and for next to no money, after other hotels had told them they would have to pay for a full night. That's the kind of guy I want to give my business to.

Many many thanks to Yousuf, Ebru and Omit( hope i got his spelling correct) for the best hospitality ever shown to us. They made our trip to IStanbul more than pleasant.Perfect location,clean rooms, fantastic breakfast spread,lovely cakes/cookies freshly everyday and the innumerable cups of turkish coffee makes this place the ideal holiday haven.Must go people ..

This hotel ticks all the boxes for a stay in Istanbul - right in the middle of all the action, reasonably priced, clean and tidy and an extensive breakfast to start the day off. Yusef goes out of his way to make sure that his guests have a great time - he'll tell you what to see, what not to bother with, how to get around and how to get the best deals on visiting the sights and using Istanbul's seriously good public transport system.

Firstly a HUGE thank you to the many (previous) reviewers who took the time out to post reviews. I did some research when planning for my holiday to Istanbul and after reading your positive reviews; decided to go with World Heritage Hotel. They offer an array of complimentary sumptuous cakes and melt in the mouth biscuits with beverage at reception (as standard!) which is a lovely gesture and much appreciated after a long day of touring/sightseeing, this in addition to a great breakfast selection of bread, jam, cereal, pastries, omelettes, savoury Turkish egg/cheese pancakes, cold meats, sausages etc. They also have a minibar which is replenished each and every day with a selection of drinks and water (my children were in drinks heaven!). House keeping is also carried out very well, good quality bed/VERY comfortable mattresses with linen to complement the tasteful furnishing too; bedsheets/duvet/pillow cases changed everyday (as well as slippers) and toiletries generously replenished too. There is wi-fi too which is great for keeping in contact digitally. It is situated at a prime location, minutes away (walking distance!) from all the famous landmarks such as Blue Mosque, Hippodrome, Hagia Sophia etc therefore being cost effective as you will save money on transport (as we did!). Secondly, the customer service is EXCELLENT - from the moment we arrived, we felt looked after. They were very attentive, caring and extremely helpful as well as fostering a very warm and friendly atmosphere in general. The team; Manager Yusuf, Supervisor Ebru, Fathi, Yashar, Umit & Co all worked very hard to ensure that we had a comfortable stay - we felt right at home and all felt as though we were all part of an extended family! We stayed for 5 days and their standards were unfaltering, their service faultless. Their local knowledge and insight was invaluable too in arranging our own tours. Everyday; either Yusuf or Ebru would recommend places and actually mark out the journey on maps (which would require a lot of patience as I'm hopeless with maps!), they have handy which made visiting places just that much more easier; in fact, the only thing they didn't do is accompany us to the trip (for obvious reasons!). Both my children thoroughly enjoyed their stay too, so much so - they didn't want to leave! You will not be disappointed as we weren't nor the many others. Yusuf/Ebru - many many thanks from the Rahim family, we'll definitely be staying at your hotel if we visit Istanbul again.

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights on our honeymoon and we were very impressed. From the moment we arrived in Istanbul, we felt very taken care of by World Heritage Hotel. They have pick-up service from the airport, and the moment you walk in they greet you with smiles and tell you how to get to the big tourist places, great places to eat, etc. They always have coffee and tea available as well as some yummy snacks available in the lobby as well. The rooms are small but very charming and comfortable, and they were always clean. The service is what really made this hotel spectacular. Every time you come or go, they always greet you with a smile and make sure you know where you are going or they help with suggestions. They are very genuine in their service- something we really appreciated. The buffet breakfast in the morning is delicious and they even make personal omelets for you! If we ever return to Istanbul, we would stay here again and we highly recommend it to anyone going to Istanbul!

We thoroughly enjoyed our two nights at The World Heritage hotel. Yusuf is a wonderful host so helpful and friendly, he was always prepared to spend time with you helping you plan your sightseeing for the day or helping out with any problems you may have. The staff were all really nice and friendly. The hotel was in an excellent position close to the tram, shops, restaurant, Grand Bazaar etc Yusuf supplied free drinks in the fridge in the room plus tea and homemade cakes which were available in the reception area and were delicious. The morning we had to leave for the airport before breakfast, Yusuf arranged for us to be given an early breakfast which was very nice. A lovely place to stay, I can recommend it highly.

I liked everything about the hotel everything was fantastic, the staff could be more friendly, but nothing that estragsse me to stay. The rooms are superb. Everyone should visit this hotel to be happier people

We stayed at World Heritage Hotel Istanbul because of the reviews on trip advisor, and yes they are true - Yusuf and his team could not have been more helpful and genuinely hospitable. This is not a 5 star hotel with a pool and gym its a comfortable quirky small hotel in a great central location - 5 minutes or less to the Blue Mosque - World Heritage is a hotel you want to shout about and one you will want to return to.

My wife and I enjoyed a fabulous stay at the World Heritage Hotel, Sultanahmet, Istanbul. This is a charming boutique hotel in a great location, within a short walk from the all the attractions, shops and restaurants in the old town. The service could not have been better, the staff were very welcoming and helpful and, as others have pointed out, there is always a selection of coffee and cakes available. The hotel is also excellent value for money, you could easily pay a lot more for a hotel which is not nearly as good as the WHH. We have already recommended this hotel to friends who are thinking of visiting Istanbul.

This hotel was a great choice. Attentive and kind staff, they will offer you a cup of tea or coffee and cake everyday when you arrive from your sightseeing. Yusuf (at the reception) will take 30 minutes and explain you important things for your visit on your arrival, recommending restaurants and things to do or not to do. We followed his recommendations and everything was just great. Breakfast was very good. They will have cold soft drinks at your minibar everyday for free!

I know I'm not adding anything the others before me haven't said, but this place is truly excellent. We travel a lot, and I think I'm pretty good at finding hotels that have great locations, good value, and other important intangibles. This hotel is everything we ever could have asked for! As others have pointed out, Yusef is wonderful. And so is his staff. He is jovial, knowledgable, flexible, and he truly cares about your visit. Everyone we interacted with at the hotel really, really wanted you to love your stay there, and that's something I have yet to find in even the nicest (in terms of star ratings) hotels I've been to. As others have mentioned, he will give you maps, and outline an itinerary for you that he thinks will allow you to make the best of your stay in Istanbul. He's very knowledgable about how to get around, and offers up little shortcuts here and there to make your life easier. The hotel itself is fantastic. It is a two minute walk from the Sultanahmet tram station, which will get you basically anywhere you need to go. While it is in walking distance from most of the major attractions, it also somehow isn't in the middle of the really touristy part of the old city, which saves you from being accosted by every store and restaurant owner when you're ready to wrap up your night. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the room clean and modern. From the pictures, I thought the bathroom was a little kitchy (with the gold trim and all), but when you see it in person, you see that's it's a very thoughtfully put together accommodation. The free minibar is amazing, because elsewhere on our trip throughout Turkey and Greece, water was expensive and not easy to come by. The breakfasts are fantastic. There is no reason to have the wide selection they have - and yet they do! And they'll make you an omelette if you really want one, but just trust me and eat the menemen or cheese pie. Every afternoon or evening, when you're coming in for a recharge or to rest up for the next day, there is complimentary Turkish Tea and cakes. More often than not, they would rather make the tea for you so you can relax. And it is all very, very tasty. In additional to all of that (and I think that's enough!), at one point in our stay, there was a child just screaming in the hotel.

The service could not have been better, the staff were very welcoming and helpful and, as others have pointed out, there is always a selection of coffee and cakes available. The hotel is also excellent value for money, you could easily pay a lot more for a hotel which is not nearly as good as the WHH. We have already recommended this hotel to friends who are thinking of visiting Istanbul.

This hotel was a great choice. Attentive and kind staff, they will offer you a cup of tea or coffee and cake everyday when you arrive from your sightseeing. Yusuf (at the reception) will take 30 minutes and explain you important things for your visit on your arrival, recommending restaurants and things to do or not to do. We followed his recommendations and everything was just great. Breakfast was very good. They will have cold soft drinks at your minibar everyday for free!

I know I'm not adding anything the others before me haven't said, but this place is truly excellent. We travel a lot, and I think I'm pretty good at finding hotels that have great locations, good value, and other important intangibles. This hotel is everything we ever could have asked for! As others have pointed out, Yusef is wonderful. And so is his staff. He is jovial, knowledgable, flexible, and he truly cares about your visit. Everyone we interacted with at the hotel really, really wanted you to love your stay there, and that's something I have yet to find in even the nicest (in terms of star ratings) hotels I've been to. As others have mentioned, he will give you maps, and outline an itinerary for you that he thinks will allow you to make the best of your stay in Istanbul. He's very knowledgable about how to get around, and offers up little shortcuts here and there to make your life easier. The hotel itself is fantastic. It is a two minute walk from the Sultanahmet tram station, which will get you basically anywhere you need to go. While it is in walking distance from most of the major attractions, it also somehow isn't in the middle of the really touristy part of the old city, which saves you from being accosted by every store and restaurant owner when you're ready to wrap up your night. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the room clean and modern. From the pictures, I thought the bathroom was a little kitchy (with the gold trim and all), but when you see it in person, you see that's it's a very thoughtfully put together accommodation. The free minibar is amazing, because elsewhere on our trip throughout Turkey and Greece, water was expensive and not easy to come by. The breakfasts are fantastic. There is no reason to have the wide selection they have - and yet they do! And they'll make you an omelette if you really want one, but just trust me and eat the menemen or cheese pie. Every afternoon or evening, when you're coming in for a recharge or to rest up for the next day, there is complimentary Turkish Tea and cakes. More often than not, they would rather make the tea for you so you can relax. And it is all very, very tasty. In additional to all of that (and I think that's enough!), at one point in our stay, there was a child just screaming in the hotel. It was during the day, not a big deal, but as we were heading out I mentioned that someone had a really unhappy child to Yusef. He explained to me that the family of five was just spending a few hours in that room until they could catch their plane. Their flight into Istanbul had been severely delayed, and it was thunderstorming outside, so the family was just looking for a place to spend a few hours to dry off and warm up until it was time to go back to the airport. Yusef let them have the room for a while, and for next to no money, after other hotels had told them they would have to pay for a full night. That's the kind of guy I want to give my business to.

Many many thanks to Yousuf, Ebru and Omit( hope i got his spelling correct) for the best hospitality ever shown to us. They made our trip to IStanbul more than pleasant.Perfect location,clean rooms, fantastic breakfast spread,lovely cakes/cookies freshly everyday and the innumerable cups of turkish coffee makes this place the ideal holiday haven.Must go people ..

This hotel ticks all the boxes for a stay in Istanbul - right in the middle of all the action, reasonably priced, clean and tidy and an extensive breakfast to start the day off. Yusef goes out of his way to make sure that his guests have a great time - he'll tell you what to see, what not to bother with, how to get around and how to get the best deals on visiting the sights and using Istanbul's seriously good public transport system.

Firstly a HUGE thank you to the many (previous) reviewers who took the time out to post reviews. I did some research when planning for my holiday to Istanbul and after reading your positive reviews; decided to go with World Heritage Hotel. They offer an array of complimentary sumptuous cakes and melt in the mouth biscuits with beverage at reception (as standard!) which is a lovely gesture and much appreciated after a long day of touring/sightseeing, this in addition to a great breakfast selection of bread, jam, cereal, pastries, omelettes, savoury Turkish egg/cheese pancakes, cold meats, sausages etc. They also have a minibar which is replenished each and every day with a selection of drinks and water (my children were in drinks heaven!). House keeping is also carried out very well, good quality bed/VERY comfortable mattresses with linen to complement the tasteful furnishing too; bedsheets/duvet/pillow cases changed everyday (as well as slippers) and toiletries generously replenished too. There is wi-fi too which is great for keeping in contact digitally. It is situated at a prime location, minutes away (walking distance!) from all the famous landmarks such as Blue Mosque, Hippodrome, Hagia Sophia etc therefore being cost effective as you will save money on transport (as we did!). Secondly, the customer service is EXCELLENT - from the moment we arrived, we felt looked after. They were very attentive, caring and extremely helpful as well as fostering a very warm and friendly atmosphere in general. The team; Manager Yusuf, Supervisor Ebru, Fathi, Yashar, Umit & Co all worked very hard to ensure that we had a comfortable stay - we felt right at home and all felt as though we were all part of an extended family! We stayed for 5 days and their standards were unfaltering, their service faultless. Their local knowledge and insight was invaluable too in arranging our own tours. Everyday; either Yusuf or Ebru would recommend places and actually mark out the journey on maps (which would require a lot of patience as I'm hopeless with maps!), they have handy which made visiting places just that much more easier; in fact, the only thing they didn't do is accompany us to the trip (for obvious reasons!). Both my children thoroughly enjoyed their stay too, so much so - they didn't want to leave! You will not be disappointed as we weren't nor the many others. Yusuf/Ebru - many many thanks from the Rahim family, we'll definitely be staying at your hotel if we visit Istanbul again.

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights on our honeymoon and we were very impressed. From the moment we arrived in Istanbul, we felt very taken care of by World Heritage Hotel. They have pick-up service from the airport, and the moment you walk in they greet you with smiles and tell you how to get to the big tourist places, great places to eat, etc. They always have coffee and tea available as well as some yummy snacks available in the lobby as well. The rooms are small but very charming and comfortable, and they were always clean. The service is what really made this hotel spectacular. Every time you come or go, they always greet you with a smile and make sure you know where you are going or they help with suggestions. They are very genuine in their service- something we really appreciated. The buffet breakfast in the morning is delicious and they even make personal omelets for you! If we ever return to Istanbul, we would stay here again and we highly recommend it to anyone going to Istanbul!

We thoroughly enjoyed our two nights at The World Heritage hotel. Yusuf is a wonderful host so helpful and friendly, he was always prepared to spend time with you helping you plan your sightseeing for the day or helping out with any problems you may have. The staff were all really nice and friendly. The hotel was in an excellent position close to the tram, shops, restaurant, Grand Bazaar etc Yusuf supplied free drinks in the fridge in the room plus tea and homemade cakes which were available in the reception area and were delicious. The morning we had to leave for the airport before breakfast, Yusuf arranged for us to be given an early breakfast which was very nice. A lovely place to stay, I can recommend it highly.

I liked everything about the hotel everything was fantastic, the staff could be more friendly, but nothing that estragsse me to stay. The rooms are superb. Everyone should visit this hotel to be happier people

We stayed at World Heritage Hotel Istanbul because of the reviews on trip advisor, and yes they are true - Yusuf and his team could not have been more helpful and genuinely hospitable. This is not a 5 star hotel with a pool and gym its a comfortable quirky small hotel in a great central location - 5 minutes or less to the Blue Mosque - World Heritage is a hotel you want to shout about and one you will want to return to.

We stayed for 5 days and their standards were unfaltering, their service faultless. Their local knowledge and insight was invaluable too in arranging our own tours. Everyday; either Yusuf or Ebru would recommend places and actually mark out the journey on maps (which would require a lot of patience as I'm hopeless with maps!), they have handy which made visiting places just that much more easier; in fact, the only thing they didn't do is accompany us to the trip (for obvious reasons!). Both my children thoroughly enjoyed their stay too, so much so - they didn't want to leave! You will not be disappointed as we weren't nor the many others. Yusuf/Ebru - many many thanks from the Rahim family, we'll definitely be staying at your hotel if we visit Istanbul again.

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights on our honeymoon and we were very impressed. From the moment we arrived in Istanbul, we felt very taken care of by World Heritage Hotel. They have pick-up service from the airport, and the moment you walk in they greet you with smiles and tell you how to get to the big tourist places, great places to eat, etc. They always have coffee and tea available as well as some yummy snacks available in the lobby as well. The rooms are small but very charming and comfortable, and they were always clean. The service is what really made this hotel spectacular. Every time you come or go, they always greet you with a smile and make sure you know where you are going or they help with suggestions. They are very genuine in their service- something we really appreciated. The buffet breakfast in the morning is delicious and they even make personal omelets for you! If we ever return to Istanbul, we would stay here again and we highly recommend it to anyone going to Istanbul!

We thoroughly enjoyed our two nights at The World Heritage hotel. Yusuf is a wonderful host so helpful and friendly, he was always prepared to spend time with you helping you plan your sightseeing for the day or helping out with any problems you may have. The staff were all really nice and friendly. The hotel was in an excellent position close to the tram, shops, restaurant, Grand Bazaar etc Yusuf supplied free drinks in the fridge in the room plus tea and homemade cakes which were available in the reception area and were delicious. The morning we had to leave for the airport before breakfast, Yusuf arranged for us to be given an early breakfast which was very nice. A lovely place to stay, I can recommend it highly.

I liked everything about the hotel everything was fantastic, the staff could be more friendly, but nothing that estragsse me to stay. The rooms are superb. Everyone should visit this hotel to be happier people

We stayed at World Heritage Hotel Istanbul because of the reviews on trip advisor, and yes they are true - Yusuf and his team could not have been more helpful and genuinely hospitable. This is not a 5 star hotel with a pool and gym its a comfortable quirky small hotel in a great central location - 5 minutes or less to the Blue Mosque - World Heritage is a hotel you want to shout about and one you will want to return to.

My wife and I enjoyed a fabulous stay at the World Heritage Hotel, Sultanahmet, Istanbul. This is a charming boutique hotel in a great location, within a short walk from the all the attractions, shops and restaurants in the old town. The service could not have been better, the staff were very welcoming and helpful and, as others have pointed out, there is always a selection of coffee and cakes available. The hotel is also excellent value for money, you could easily pay a lot more for a hotel which is not nearly as good as the WHH. We have already recommended this hotel to friends who are thinking of visiting Istanbul.

This hotel was a great choice. Attentive and kind staff, they will offer you a cup of tea or coffee and cake everyday when you arrive from your sightseeing. Yusuf (at the reception) will take 30 minutes and explain you important things for your visit on your arrival, recommending restaurants and things to do or not to do. We followed his recommendations and everything was just great. Breakfast was very good. They will have cold soft drinks at your minibar everyday for free!

I know I'm not adding anything the others before me haven't said, but this place is truly excellent. We travel a lot, and I think I'm pretty good at finding hotels that have great locations, good value, and other important intangibles. This hotel is everything we ever could have asked for! As others have pointed out, Yusef is wonderful. And so is his staff. He is jovial, knowledgable, flexible, and he truly cares about your visit. Everyone we interacted with at the hotel really, really wanted you to love your stay there, and that's something I have yet to find in even the nicest (in terms of star ratings) hotels I've been to. As others have mentioned, he will give you maps, and outline an itinerary for you that he thinks will allow you to make the best of your stay in Istanbul. He's very knowledgable about how to get around, and offers up little shortcuts here and there to make your life easier. The hotel itself is fantastic. It is a two minute walk from the Sultanahmet tram station, which will get you basically anywhere you need to go. While it is in walking distance from most of the major attractions, it also somehow isn't in the middle of the really touristy part of the old city, which saves you from being accosted by every store and restaurant owner when you're ready to wrap up your night. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the room clean and modern. From the pictures, I thought the bathroom was a little kitchy (with the gold trim and all), but when you see it in person, you see that's it's a very thoughtfully put together accommodation. The free minibar is amazing, because elsewhere on our trip throughout Turkey and Greece, water was expensive and not easy to come by. The breakfasts are fantastic. There is no reason to have the wide selection they have - and yet they do! And they'll make you an omelette if you really want one, but just trust me and eat the menemen or cheese pie. Every afternoon or evening, when you're coming in for a recharge or to rest up for the next day, there is complimentary Turkish Tea and cakes. More often than not, they would rather make the tea for you so you can relax. And it is all very, very tasty. In additional to all of that (and I think that's enough!), at one point in our stay, there was a child just screaming in the hotel. It was during the day, not a big deal, but as we were heading out I mentioned that someone had a really unhappy child to Yusef. He explained to me that the family of five was just spending a few hours in that room until they could catch their plane. Their flight into Istanbul had been severely delayed, and it was thunderstorming outside, so the family was just looking for a place to spend a few hours to dry off and warm up until it was time to go back to the airport. Yusef let them have the room for a while, and for next to no money, after other hotels had told them they would have to pay for a full night. That's the kind of guy I want to give my business to.

Many many thanks to Yousuf, Ebru and Omit( hope i got his spelling correct) for the best hospitality ever shown to us. They made our trip to IStanbul more than pleasant.Perfect location,clean rooms, fantastic breakfast spread,lovely cakes/cookies freshly everyday and the innumerable cups of turkish coffee makes this place the ideal holiday haven.Must go people ..

This hotel ticks all the boxes for a stay in Istanbul - right in the middle of all the action, reasonably priced, clean and tidy and an extensive breakfast to start the day off. Yusef goes out of his way to make sure that his guests have a great time - he'll tell you what to see, what not to bother with, how to get around and how to get the best deals on visiting the sights and using Istanbul's seriously good public transport system.

Firstly a HUGE thank you to the many (previous) reviewers who took the time out to post reviews. I did some research when planning for my holiday to Istanbul and after reading your positive reviews; decided to go with World Heritage Hotel. They offer an array of complimentary sumptuous cakes and melt in the mouth biscuits with beverage at reception (as standard!) which is a lovely gesture and much appreciated after a long day of touring/sightseeing, this in addition to a great breakfast selection of bread, jam, cereal, pastries, omelettes, savoury Turkish egg/cheese pancakes, cold meats, sausages etc. They also have a minibar which is replenished each and every day with a selection of drinks and water (my children were in drinks heaven!). House keeping is also carried out very well, good quality bed/VERY comfortable mattresses with linen to complement the tasteful furnishing too; bedsheets/duvet/pillow cases changed everyday (as well as slippers) and toiletries generously replenished too. There is wi-fi too which is great for keeping in contact digitally. It is situated at a prime location, minutes away (walking distance!) from all the famous landmarks such as Blue Mosque, Hippodrome, Hagia Sophia etc therefore being cost effective as you will save money on transport (as we did!). Secondly, the customer service is EXCELLENT - from the moment we arrived, we felt looked after. They were very attentive, caring and extremely helpful as well as fostering a very warm and friendly atmosphere in general. The team; Manager Yusuf, Supervisor Ebru, Fathi, Yashar, Umit & Co all worked very hard to ensure that we had a comfortable stay - we felt right at home and all felt as though we were all part of an extended family!

It was during the day, not a big deal, but as we were heading out I mentioned that someone had a really unhappy child to Yusef. He explained to me that the family of five was just spending a few hours in that room until they could catch their plane. Their flight into Istanbul had been severely delayed, and it was thunderstorming outside, so the family was just looking for a place to spend a few hours to dry off and warm up until it was time to go back to the airport. Yusef let them have the room for a while, and for next to no money, after other hotels had told them they would have to pay for a full night. That's the kind of guy I want to give my business to.

Many many thanks to Yousuf, Ebru and Omit( hope i got his spelling correct) for the best hospitality ever shown to us. They made our trip to IStanbul more than pleasant.Perfect location,clean rooms, fantastic breakfast spread,lovely cakes/cookies freshly everyday and the innumerable cups of turkish coffee makes this place the ideal holiday haven.Must go people ..

This hotel ticks all the boxes for a stay in Istanbul - right in the middle of all the action, reasonably priced, clean and tidy and an extensive breakfast to start the day off. Yusef goes out of his way to make sure that his guests have a great time - he'll tell you what to see, what not to bother with, how to get around and how to get the best deals on visiting the sights and using Istanbul's seriously good public transport system.

Firstly a HUGE thank you to the many (previous) reviewers who took the time out to post reviews. I did some research when planning for my holiday to Istanbul and after reading your positive reviews; decided to go with World Heritage Hotel. They offer an array of complimentary sumptuous cakes and melt in the mouth biscuits with beverage at reception (as standard!) which is a lovely gesture and much appreciated after a long day of touring/sightseeing, this in addition to a great breakfast selection of bread, jam, cereal, pastries, omelettes, savoury Turkish egg/cheese pancakes, cold meats, sausages etc. They also have a minibar which is replenished each and every day with a selection of drinks and water (my children were in drinks heaven!). House keeping is also carried out very well, good quality bed/VERY comfortable mattresses with linen to complement the tasteful furnishing too; bedsheets/duvet/pillow cases changed everyday (as well as slippers) and toiletries generously replenished too. There is wi-fi too which is great for keeping in contact digitally. It is situated at a prime location, minutes away (walking distance!) from all the famous landmarks such as Blue Mosque, Hippodrome, Hagia Sophia etc therefore being cost effective as you will save money on transport (as we did!). Secondly, the customer service is EXCELLENT - from the moment we arrived, we felt looked after. They were very attentive, caring and extremely helpful as well as fostering a very warm and friendly atmosphere in general. The team; Manager Yusuf, Supervisor Ebru, Fathi, Yashar, Umit & Co all worked very hard to ensure that we had a comfortable stay - we felt right at home and all felt as though we were all part of an extended family! We stayed for 5 days and their standards were unfaltering, their service faultless. Their local knowledge and insight was invaluable too in arranging our own tours. Everyday; either Yusuf or Ebru would recommend places and actually mark out the journey on maps (which would require a lot of patience as I'm hopeless with maps!), they have handy which made visiting places just that much more easier; in fact, the only thing they didn't do is accompany us to the trip (for obvious reasons!). Both my children thoroughly enjoyed their stay too, so much so - they didn't want to leave! You will not be disappointed as we weren't nor the many others. Yusuf/Ebru - many many thanks from the Rahim family, we'll definitely be staying at your hotel if we visit Istanbul again.

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights on our honeymoon and we were very impressed. From the moment we arrived in Istanbul, we felt very taken care of by World Heritage Hotel. They have pick-up service from the airport, and the moment you walk in they greet you with smiles and tell you how to get to the big tourist places, great places to eat, etc. They always have coffee and tea available as well as some yummy snacks available in the lobby as well. The rooms are small but very charming and comfortable, and they were always clean. The service is what really made this hotel spectacular. Every time you come or go, they always greet you with a smile and make sure you know where you are going or they help with suggestions. They are very genuine in their service- something we really appreciated. The buffet breakfast in the morning is delicious and they even make personal omelets for you! If we ever return to Istanbul, we would stay here again and we highly recommend it to anyone going to Istanbul!

We thoroughly enjoyed our two nights at The World Heritage hotel. Yusuf is a wonderful host so helpful and friendly, he was always prepared to spend time with you helping you plan your sightseeing for the day or helping out with any problems you may have. The staff were all really nice and friendly. The hotel was in an excellent position close to the tram, shops, restaurant, Grand Bazaar etc Yusuf supplied free drinks in the fridge in the room plus tea and homemade cakes which were available in the reception area and were delicious. The morning we had to leave for the airport before breakfast, Yusuf arranged for us to be given an early breakfast which was very nice. A lovely place to stay, I can recommend it highly.

I liked everything about the hotel everything was fantastic, the staff could be more friendly, but nothing that estragsse me to stay. The rooms are superb. Everyone should visit this hotel to be happier people

We stayed at World Heritage Hotel Istanbul because of the reviews on trip advisor, and yes they are true - Yusuf and his team could not have been more helpful and genuinely hospitable. This is not a 5 star hotel with a pool and gym its a comfortable quirky small hotel in a great central location - 5 minutes or less to the Blue Mosque - World Heritage is a hotel you want to shout about and one you will want to return to.

My wife and I enjoyed a fabulous stay at the World Heritage Hotel, Sultanahmet, Istanbul. This is a charming boutique hotel in a great location, within a short walk from the all the attractions, shops and restaurants in the old town. The service could not have been better, the staff were very welcoming and helpful and, as others have pointed out, there is always a selection of coffee and cakes available. The hotel is also excellent value for money, you could easily pay a lot more for a hotel which is not nearly as good as the WHH. We have already recommended this hotel to friends who are thinking of visiting Istanbul.

This hotel was a great choice. Attentive and kind staff, they will offer you a cup of tea or coffee and cake everyday when you arrive from your sightseeing. Yusuf (at the reception) will take 30 minutes and explain you important things for your visit on your arrival, recommending restaurants and things to do or not to do. We followed his recommendations and everything was just great. Breakfast was very good. They will have cold soft drinks at your minibar everyday for free!

I know I'm not adding anything the others before me haven't said, but this place is truly excellent. We travel a lot, and I think I'm pretty good at finding hotels that have great locations, good value, and other important intangibles. This hotel is everything we ever could have asked for! As others have pointed out, Yusef is wonderful. And so is his staff. He is jovial, knowledgable, flexible, and he truly cares about your visit. Everyone we interacted with at the hotel really, really wanted you to love your stay there, and that's something I have yet to find in even the nicest (in terms of star ratings) hotels I've been to. As others have mentioned, he will give you maps, and outline an itinerary for you that he thinks will allow you to make the best of your stay in Istanbul. He's very knowledgable about how to get around, and offers up little shortcuts here and there to make your life easier. The hotel itself is fantastic. It is a two minute walk from the Sultanahmet tram station, which will get you basically anywhere you need to go. While it is in walking distance from most of the major attractions, it also somehow isn't in the middle of the really touristy part of the old city, which saves you from being accosted by every store and restaurant owner when you're ready to wrap up your night. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the room clean and modern. From the pictures, I thought the bathroom was a little kitchy (with the gold trim and all), but when you see it in person, you see that's it's a very thoughtfully put together accommodation. The free minibar is amazing, because elsewhere on our trip throughout Turkey and Greece, water was expensive and not easy to come by. The breakfasts are fantastic. There is no reason to have the wide selection they have - and yet they do! And they'll make you an omelette if you really want one, but just trust me and eat the menemen or cheese pie. Every afternoon or evening, when you're coming in for a recharge or to rest up for the next day, there is complimentary Turkish Tea and cakes. More often than not, they would rather make the tea for you so you can relax. And it is all very, very tasty. In additional to all of that (and I think that's enough!), at one point in our stay, there was a child just screaming in the hotel.

The service could not have been better, the staff were very welcoming and helpful and, as others have pointed out, there is always a selection of coffee and cakes available. The hotel is also excellent value for money, you could easily pay a lot more for a hotel which is not nearly as good as the WHH. We have already recommended this hotel to friends who are thinking of visiting Istanbul.

This hotel was a great choice. Attentive and kind staff, they will offer you a cup of tea or coffee and cake everyday when you arrive from your sightseeing. Yusuf (at the reception) will take 30 minutes and explain you important things for your visit on your arrival, recommending restaurants and things to do or not to do. We followed his recommendations and everything was just great. Breakfast was very good. They will have cold soft drinks at your minibar everyday for free!

I know I'm not adding anything the others before me haven't said, but this place is truly excellent. We travel a lot, and I think I'm pretty good at finding hotels that have great locations, good value, and other important intangibles. This hotel is everything we ever could have asked for! As others have pointed out, Yusef is wonderful. And so is his staff. He is jovial, knowledgable, flexible, and he truly cares about your visit. Everyone we interacted with at the hotel really, really wanted you to love your stay there, and that's something I have yet to find in even the nicest (in terms of star ratings) hotels I've been to. As others have mentioned, he will give you maps, and outline an itinerary for you that he thinks will allow you to make the best of your stay in Istanbul. He's very knowledgable about how to get around, and offers up little shortcuts here and there to make your life easier. The hotel itself is fantastic. It is a two minute walk from the Sultanahmet tram station, which will get you basically anywhere you need to go. While it is in walking distance from most of the major attractions, it also somehow isn't in the middle of the really touristy part of the old city, which saves you from being accosted by every store and restaurant owner when you're ready to wrap up your night. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the room clean and modern. From the pictures, I thought the bathroom was a little kitchy (with the gold trim and all), but when you see it in person, you see that's it's a very thoughtfully put together accommodation. The free minibar is amazing, because elsewhere on our trip throughout Turkey and Greece, water was expensive and not easy to come by. The breakfasts are fantastic. There is no reason to have the wide selection they have - and yet they do! And they'll make you an omelette if you really want one, but just trust me and eat the menemen or cheese pie. Every afternoon or evening, when you're coming in for a recharge or to rest up for the next day, there is complimentary Turkish Tea and cakes. More often than not, they would rather make the tea for you so you can relax. And it is all very, very tasty. In additional to all of that (and I think that's enough!), at one point in our stay, there was a child just screaming in the hotel. It was during the day, not a big deal, but as we were heading out I mentioned that someone had a really unhappy child to Yusef. He explained to me that the family of five was just spending a few hours in that room until they could catch their plane. Their flight into Istanbul had been severely delayed, and it was thunderstorming outside, so the family was just looking for a place to spend a few hours to dry off and warm up until it was time to go back to the airport. Yusef let them have the room for a while, and for next to no money, after other hotels had told them they would have to pay for a full night. That's the kind of guy I want to give my business to.

Many many thanks to Yousuf, Ebru and Omit( hope i got his spelling correct) for the best hospitality ever shown to us. They made our trip to IStanbul more than pleasant.Perfect location,clean rooms, fantastic breakfast spread,lovely cakes/cookies freshly everyday and the innumerable cups of turkish coffee makes this place the ideal holiday haven.Must go people ..

This hotel ticks all the boxes for a stay in Istanbul - right in the middle of all the action, reasonably priced, clean and tidy and an extensive breakfast to start the day off. Yusef goes out of his way to make sure that his guests have a great time - he'll tell you what to see, what not to bother with, how to get around and how to get the best deals on visiting the sights and using Istanbul's seriously good public transport system.

Firstly a HUGE thank you to the many (previous) reviewers who took the time out to post reviews. I did some research when planning for my holiday to Istanbul and after reading your positive reviews; decided to go with World Heritage Hotel. They offer an array of complimentary sumptuous cakes and melt in the mouth biscuits with beverage at reception (as standard!) which is a lovely gesture and much appreciated after a long day of touring/sightseeing, this in addition to a great breakfast selection of bread, jam, cereal, pastries, omelettes, savoury Turkish egg/cheese pancakes, cold meats, sausages etc. They also have a minibar which is replenished each and every day with a selection of drinks and water (my children were in drinks heaven!). House keeping is also carried out very well, good quality bed/VERY comfortable mattresses with linen to complement the tasteful furnishing too; bedsheets/duvet/pillow cases changed everyday (as well as slippers) and toiletries generously replenished too. There is wi-fi too which is great for keeping in contact digitally. It is situated at a prime location, minutes away (walking distance!) from all the famous landmarks such as Blue Mosque, Hippodrome, Hagia Sophia etc therefore being cost effective as you will save money on transport (as we did!). Secondly, the customer service is EXCELLENT - from the moment we arrived, we felt looked after. They were very attentive, caring and extremely helpful as well as fostering a very warm and friendly atmosphere in general. The team; Manager Yusuf, Supervisor Ebru, Fathi, Yashar, Umit & Co all worked very hard to ensure that we had a comfortable stay - we felt right at home and all felt as though we were all part of an extended family! We stayed for 5 days and their standards were unfaltering, their service faultless. Their local knowledge and insight was invaluable too in arranging our own tours. Everyday; either Yusuf or Ebru would recommend places and actually mark out the journey on maps (which would require a lot of patience as I'm hopeless with maps!), they have handy which made visiting places just that much more easier; in fact, the only thing they didn't do is accompany us to the trip (for obvious reasons!). Both my children thoroughly enjoyed their stay too, so much so - they didn't want to leave! You will not be disappointed as we weren't nor the many others. Yusuf/Ebru - many many thanks from the Rahim family, we'll definitely be staying at your hotel if we visit Istanbul again.

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights on our honeymoon and we were very impressed. From the moment we arrived in Istanbul, we felt very taken care of by World Heritage Hotel. They have pick-up service from the airport, and the moment you walk in they greet you with smiles and tell you how to get to the big tourist places, great places to eat, etc. They always have coffee and tea available as well as some yummy snacks available in the lobby as well. The rooms are small but very charming and comfortable, and they were always clean. The service is what really made this hotel spectacular. Every time you come or go, they always greet you with a smile and make sure you know where you are going or they help with suggestions. They are very genuine in their service- something we really appreciated. The buffet breakfast in the morning is delicious and they even make personal omelets for you! If we ever return to Istanbul, we would stay here again and we highly recommend it to anyone going to Istanbul!

We thoroughly enjoyed our two nights at The World Heritage hotel. Yusuf is a wonderful host so helpful and friendly, he was always prepared to spend time with you helping you plan your sightseeing for the day or helping out with any problems you may have. The staff were all really nice and friendly. The hotel was in an excellent position close to the tram, shops, restaurant, Grand Bazaar etc Yusuf supplied free drinks in the fridge in the room plus tea and homemade cakes which were available in the reception area and were delicious. The morning we had to leave for the airport before breakfast, Yusuf arranged for us to be given an early breakfast which was very nice. A lovely place to stay, I can recommend it highly.

I liked everything about the hotel everything was fantastic, the staff could be more friendly, but nothing that estragsse me to stay. The rooms are superb. Everyone should visit this hotel to be happier people

We stayed at World Heritage Hotel Istanbul because of the reviews on trip advisor, and yes they are true - Yusuf and his team could not have been more helpful and genuinely hospitable. This is not a 5 star hotel with a pool and gym its a comfortable quirky small hotel in a great central location - 5 minutes or less to the Blue Mosque - World Heritage is a hotel you want to shout about and one you will want to return to.

We stayed for 5 days and their standards were unfaltering, their service faultless. Their local knowledge and insight was invaluable too in arranging our own tours. Everyday; either Yusuf or Ebru would recommend places and actually mark out the journey on maps (which would require a lot of patience as I'm hopeless with maps!), they have handy which made visiting places just that much more easier; in fact, the only thing they didn't do is accompany us to the trip (for obvious reasons!). Both my children thoroughly enjoyed their stay too, so much so - they didn't want to leave! You will not be disappointed as we weren't nor the many others. Yusuf/Ebru - many many thanks from the Rahim family, we'll definitely be staying at your hotel if we visit Istanbul again.

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights on our honeymoon and we were very impressed. From the moment we arrived in Istanbul, we felt very taken care of by World Heritage Hotel. They have pick-up service from the airport, and the moment you walk in they greet you with smiles and tell you how to get to the big tourist places, great places to eat, etc. They always have coffee and tea available as well as some yummy snacks available in the lobby as well. The rooms are small but very charming and comfortable, and they were always clean. The service is what really made this hotel spectacular. Every time you come or go, they always greet you with a smile and make sure you know where you are going or they help with suggestions. They are very genuine in their service- something we really appreciated. The buffet breakfast in the morning is delicious and they even make personal omelets for you! If we ever return to Istanbul, we would stay here again and we highly recommend it to anyone going to Istanbul!

We thoroughly enjoyed our two nights at The World Heritage hotel. Yusuf is a wonderful host so helpful and friendly, he was always prepared to spend time with you helping you plan your sightseeing for the day or helping out with any problems you may have. The staff were all really nice and friendly. The hotel was in an excellent position close to the tram, shops, restaurant, Grand Bazaar etc Yusuf supplied free drinks in the fridge in the room plus tea and homemade cakes which were available in the reception area and were delicious. The morning we had to leave for the airport before breakfast, Yusuf arranged for us to be given an early breakfast which was very nice. A lovely place to stay, I can recommend it highly.

I liked everything about the hotel everything was fantastic, the staff could be more friendly, but nothing that estragsse me to stay. The rooms are superb. Everyone should visit this hotel to be happier people

We stayed at World Heritage Hotel Istanbul because of the reviews on trip advisor, and yes they are true - Yusuf and his team could not have been more helpful and genuinely hospitable. This is not a 5 star hotel with a pool and gym its a comfortable quirky small hotel in a great central location - 5 minutes or less to the Blue Mosque - World Heritage is a hotel you want to shout about and one you will want to return to.

My wife and I enjoyed a fabulous stay at the World Heritage Hotel, Sultanahmet, Istanbul. This is a charming boutique hotel in a great location, within a short walk from the all the attractions, shops and restaurants in the old town. The service could not have been better, the staff were very welcoming and helpful and, as others have pointed out, there is always a selection of coffee and cakes available. The hotel is also excellent value for money, you could easily pay a lot more for a hotel which is not nearly as good as the WHH. We have already recommended this hotel to friends who are thinking of visiting Istanbul.

This hotel was a great choice. Attentive and kind staff, they will offer you a cup of tea or coffee and cake everyday when you arrive from your sightseeing. Yusuf (at the reception) will take 30 minutes and explain you important things for your visit on your arrival, recommending restaurants and things to do or not to do. We followed his recommendations and everything was just great. Breakfast was very good. They will have cold soft drinks at your minibar everyday for free!

I know I'm not adding anything the others before me haven't said, but this place is truly excellent. We travel a lot, and I think I'm pretty good at finding hotels that have great locations, good value, and other important intangibles. This hotel is everything we ever could have asked for! As others have pointed out, Yusef is wonderful. And so is his staff. He is jovial, knowledgable, flexible, and he truly cares about your visit. Everyone we interacted with at the hotel really, really wanted you to love your stay there, and that's something I have yet to find in even the nicest (in terms of star ratings) hotels I've been to. As others have mentioned, he will give you maps, and outline an itinerary for you that he thinks will allow you to make the best of your stay in Istanbul. He's very knowledgable about how to get around, and offers up little shortcuts here and there to make your life easier. The hotel itself is fantastic. It is a two minute walk from the Sultanahmet tram station, which will get you basically anywhere you need to go. While it is in walking distance from most of the major attractions, it also somehow isn't in the middle of the really touristy part of the old city, which saves you from being accosted by every store and restaurant owner when you're ready to wrap up your night. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the room clean and modern. From the pictures, I thought the bathroom was a little kitchy (with the gold trim and all), but when you see it in person, you see that's it's a very thoughtfully put together accommodation. The free minibar is amazing, because elsewhere on our trip throughout Turkey and Greece, water was expensive and not easy to come by. The breakfasts are fantastic. There is no reason to have the wide selection they have - and yet they do! And they'll make you an omelette if you really want one, but just trust me and eat the menemen or cheese pie. Every afternoon or evening, when you're coming in for a recharge or to rest up for the next day, there is complimentary Turkish Tea and cakes. More often than not, they would rather make the tea for you so you can relax. And it is all very, very tasty. In additional to all of that (and I think that's enough!), at one point in our stay, there was a child just screaming in the hotel. It was during the day, not a big deal, but as we were heading out I mentioned that someone had a really unhappy child to Yusef. He explained to me that the family of five was just spending a few hours in that room until they could catch their plane. Their flight into Istanbul had been severely delayed, and it was thunderstorming outside, so the family was just looking for a place to spend a few hours to dry off and warm up until it was time to go back to the airport. Yusef let them have the room for a while, and for next to no money, after other hotels had told them they would have to pay for a full night. That's the kind of guy I want to give my business to.

Many many thanks to Yousuf, Ebru and Omit( hope i got his spelling correct) for the best hospitality ever shown to us. They made our trip to IStanbul more than pleasant.Perfect location,clean rooms, fantastic breakfast spread,lovely cakes/cookies freshly everyday and the innumerable cups of turkish coffee makes this place the ideal holiday haven.Must go people ..

This hotel ticks all the boxes for a stay in Istanbul - right in the middle of all the action, reasonably priced, clean and tidy and an extensive breakfast to start the day off. Yusef goes out of his way to make sure that his guests have a great time - he'll tell you what to see, what not to bother with, how to get around and how to get the best deals on visiting the sights and using Istanbul's seriously good public transport system.

Firstly a HUGE thank you to the many (previous) reviewers who took the time out to post reviews. I did some research when planning for my holiday to Istanbul and after reading your positive reviews; decided to go with World Heritage Hotel. They offer an array of complimentary sumptuous cakes and melt in the mouth biscuits with beverage at reception (as standard!) which is a lovely gesture and much appreciated after a long day of touring/sightseeing, this in addition to a great breakfast selection of bread, jam, cereal, pastries, omelettes, savoury Turkish egg/cheese pancakes, cold meats, sausages etc. They also have a minibar which is replenished each and every day with a selection of drinks and water (my children were in drinks heaven!). House keeping is also carried out very well, good quality bed/VERY comfortable mattresses with linen to complement the tasteful furnishing too; bedsheets/duvet/pillow cases changed everyday (as well as slippers) and toiletries generously replenished too. There is wi-fi too which is great for keeping in contact digitally. It is situated at a prime location, minutes away (walking distance!) from all the famous landmarks such as Blue Mosque, Hippodrome, Hagia Sophia etc therefore being cost effective as you will save money on transport (as we did!). Secondly, the customer service is EXCELLENT - from the moment we arrived, we felt looked after. They were very attentive, caring and extremely helpful as well as fostering a very warm and friendly atmosphere in general. The team; Manager Yusuf, Supervisor Ebru, Fathi, Yashar, Umit & Co all worked very hard to ensure that we had a comfortable stay - we felt right at home and all felt as though we were all part of an extended family!

It was during the day, not a big deal, but as we were heading out I mentioned that someone had a really unhappy child to Yusef. He explained to me that the family of five was just spending a few hours in that room until they could catch their plane. Their flight into Istanbul had been severely delayed, and it was thunderstorming outside, so the family was just looking for a place to spend a few hours to dry off and warm up until it was time to go back to the airport. Yusef let them have the room for a while, and for next to no money, after other hotels had told them they would have to pay for a full night. That's the kind of guy I want to give my business to.

Many many thanks to Yousuf, Ebru and Omit( hope i got his spelling correct) for the best hospitality ever shown to us. They made our trip to IStanbul more than pleasant.Perfect location,clean rooms, fantastic breakfast spread,lovely cakes/cookies freshly everyday and the innumerable cups of turkish coffee makes this place the ideal holiday haven.Must go people ..

This hotel ticks all the boxes for a stay in Istanbul - right in the middle of all the action, reasonably priced, clean and tidy and an extensive breakfast to start the day off. Yusef goes out of his way to make sure that his guests have a great time - he'll tell you what to see, what not to bother with, how to get around and how to get the best deals on visiting the sights and using Istanbul's seriously good public transport system.

Firstly a HUGE thank you to the many (previous) reviewers who took the time out to post reviews. I did some research when planning for my holiday to Istanbul and after reading your positive reviews; decided to go with World Heritage Hotel. They offer an array of complimentary sumptuous cakes and melt in the mouth biscuits with beverage at reception (as standard!) which is a lovely gesture and much appreciated after a long day of touring/sightseeing, this in addition to a great breakfast selection of bread, jam, cereal, pastries, omelettes, savoury Turkish egg/cheese pancakes, cold meats, sausages etc. They also have a minibar which is replenished each and every day with a selection of drinks and water (my children were in drinks heaven!). House keeping is also carried out very well, good quality bed/VERY comfortable mattresses with linen to complement the tasteful furnishing too; bedsheets/duvet/pillow cases changed everyday (as well as slippers) and toiletries generously replenished too. There is wi-fi too which is great for keeping in contact digitally. It is situated at a prime location, minutes away (walking distance!) from all the famous landmarks such as Blue Mosque, Hippodrome, Hagia Sophia etc therefore being cost effective as you will save money on transport (as we did!). Secondly, the customer service is EXCELLENT - from the moment we arrived, we felt looked after. They were very attentive, caring and extremely helpful as well as fostering a very warm and friendly atmosphere in general. The team; Manager Yusuf, Supervisor Ebru, Fathi, Yashar, Umit & Co all worked very hard to ensure that we had a comfortable stay - we felt right at home and all felt as though we were all part of an extended family! We stayed for 5 days and their standards were unfaltering, their service faultless. Their local knowledge and insight was invaluable too in arranging our own tours. Everyday; either Yusuf or Ebru would recommend places and actually mark out the journey on maps (which would require a lot of patience as I'm hopeless with maps!), they have handy which made visiting places just that much more easier; in fact, the only thing they didn't do is accompany us to the trip (for obvious reasons!). Both my children thoroughly enjoyed their stay too, so much so - they didn't want to leave! You will not be disappointed as we weren't nor the many others. Yusuf/Ebru - many many thanks from the Rahim family, we'll definitely be staying at your hotel if we visit Istanbul again.

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights on our honeymoon and we were very impressed. From the moment we arrived in Istanbul, we felt very taken care of by World Heritage Hotel. They have pick-up service from the airport, and the moment you walk in they greet you with smiles and tell you how to get to the big tourist places, great places to eat, etc. They always have coffee and tea available as well as some yummy snacks available in the lobby as well. The rooms are small but very charming and comfortable, and they were always clean. The service is what really made this hotel spectacular. Every time you come or go, they always greet you with a smile and make sure you know where you are going or they help with suggestions. They are very genuine in their service- something we really appreciated. The buffet breakfast in the morning is delicious and they even make personal omelets for you! If we ever return to Istanbul, we would stay here again and we highly recommend it to anyone going to Istanbul!

We thoroughly enjoyed our two nights at The World Heritage hotel. Yusuf is a wonderful host so helpful and friendly, he was always prepared to spend time with you helping you plan your sightseeing for the day or helping out with any problems you may have. The staff were all really nice and friendly. The hotel was in an excellent position close to the tram, shops, restaurant, Grand Bazaar etc Yusuf supplied free drinks in the fridge in the room plus tea and homemade cakes which were available in the reception area and were delicious. The morning we had to leave for the airport before breakfast, Yusuf arranged for us to be given an early breakfast which was very nice. A lovely place to stay, I can recommend it highly.

I liked everything about the hotel everything was fantastic, the staff could be more friendly, but nothing that estragsse me to stay. The rooms are superb. Everyone should visit this hotel to be happier people

We stayed at World Heritage Hotel Istanbul because of the reviews on trip advisor, and yes they are true - Yusuf and his team could not have been more helpful and genuinely hospitable. This is not a 5 star hotel with a pool and gym its a comfortable quirky small hotel in a great central location - 5 minutes or less to the Blue Mosque - World Heritage is a hotel you want to shout about and one you will want to return to.

My wife and I enjoyed a fabulous stay at the World Heritage Hotel, Sultanahmet, Istanbul. This is a charming boutique hotel in a great location, within a short walk from the all the attractions, shops and restaurants in the old town. The service could not have been better, the staff were very welcoming and helpful and, as others have pointed out, there is always a selection of coffee and cakes available. The hotel is also excellent value for money, you could easily pay a lot more for a hotel which is not nearly as good as the WHH. We have already recommended this hotel to friends who are thinking of visiting Istanbul.

This hotel was a great choice. Attentive and kind staff, they will offer you a cup of tea or coffee and cake everyday when you arrive from your sightseeing. Yusuf (at the reception) will take 30 minutes and explain you important things for your visit on your arrival, recommending restaurants and things to do or not to do. We followed his recommendations and everything was just great. Breakfast was very good. They will have cold soft drinks at your minibar everyday for free!

I know I'm not adding anything the others before me haven't said, but this place is truly excellent. We travel a lot, and I think I'm pretty good at finding hotels that have great locations, good value, and other important intangibles. This hotel is everything we ever could have asked for! As others have pointed out, Yusef is wonderful. And so is his staff. He is jovial, knowledgable, flexible, and he truly cares about your visit. Everyone we interacted with at the hotel really, really wanted you to love your stay there, and that's something I have yet to find in even the nicest (in terms of star ratings) hotels I've been to. As others have mentioned, he will give you maps, and outline an itinerary for you that he thinks will allow you to make the best of your stay in Istanbul. He's very knowledgable about how to get around, and offers up little shortcuts here and there to make your life easier. The hotel itself is fantastic. It is a two minute walk from the Sultanahmet tram station, which will get you basically anywhere you need to go. While it is in walking distance from most of the major attractions, it also somehow isn't in the middle of the really touristy part of the old city, which saves you from being accosted by every store and restaurant owner when you're ready to wrap up your night. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the room clean and modern. From the pictures, I thought the bathroom was a little kitchy (with the gold trim and all), but when you see it in person, you see that's it's a very thoughtfully put together accommodation. The free minibar is amazing, because elsewhere on our trip throughout Turkey and Greece, water was expensive and not easy to come by. The breakfasts are fantastic. There is no reason to have the wide selection they have - and yet they do! And they'll make you an omelette if you really want one, but just trust me and eat the menemen or cheese pie. Every afternoon or evening, when you're coming in for a recharge or to rest up for the next day, there is complimentary Turkish Tea and cakes. More often than not, they would rather make the tea for you so you can relax. And it is all very, very tasty. In additional to all of that (and I think that's enough!), at one point in our stay, there was a child just screaming in the hotel.

The service could not have been better, the staff were very welcoming and helpful and, as others have pointed out, there is always a selection of coffee and cakes available. The hotel is also excellent value for money, you could easily pay a lot more for a hotel which is not nearly as good as the WHH. We have already recommended this hotel to friends who are thinking of visiting Istanbul.

This hotel was a great choice. Attentive and kind staff, they will offer you a cup of tea or coffee and cake everyday when you arrive from your sightseeing. Yusuf (at the reception) will take 30 minutes and explain you important things for your visit on your arrival, recommending restaurants and things to do or not to do. We followed his recommendations and everything was just great. Breakfast was very good. They will have cold soft drinks at your minibar everyday for free!

I know I'm not adding anything the others before me haven't said, but this place is truly excellent. We travel a lot, and I think I'm pretty good at finding hotels that have great locations, good value, and other important intangibles. This hotel is everything we ever could have asked for! As others have pointed out, Yusef is wonderful. And so is his staff. He is jovial, knowledgable, flexible, and he truly cares about your visit. Everyone we interacted with at the hotel really, really wanted you to love your stay there, and that's something I have yet to find in even the nicest (in terms of star ratings) hotels I've been to. As others have mentioned, he will give you maps, and outline an itinerary for you that he thinks will allow you to make the best of your stay in Istanbul. He's very knowledgable about how to get around, and offers up little shortcuts here and there to make your life easier. The hotel itself is fantastic. It is a two minute walk from the Sultanahmet tram station, which will get you basically anywhere you need to go. While it is in walking distance from most of the major attractions, it also somehow isn't in the middle of the really touristy part of the old city, which saves you from being accosted by every store and restaurant owner when you're ready to wrap up your night. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the room clean and modern. From the pictures, I thought the bathroom was a little kitchy (with the gold trim and all), but when you see it in person, you see that's it's a very thoughtfully put together accommodation. The free minibar is amazing, because elsewhere on our trip throughout Turkey and Greece, water was expensive and not easy to come by. The breakfasts are fantastic. There is no reason to have the wide selection they have - and yet they do! And they'll make you an omelette if you really want one, but just trust me and eat the menemen or cheese pie. Every afternoon or evening, when you're coming in for a recharge or to rest up for the next day, there is complimentary Turkish Tea and cakes. More often than not, they would rather make the tea for you so you can relax. And it is all very, very tasty. In additional to all of that (and I think that's enough!), at one point in our stay, there was a child just screaming in the hotel. It was during the day, not a big deal, but as we were heading out I mentioned that someone had a really unhappy child to Yusef. He explained to me that the family of five was just spending a few hours in that room until they could catch their plane. Their flight into Istanbul had been severely delayed, and it was thunderstorming outside, so the family was just looking for a place to spend a few hours to dry off and warm up until it was time to go back to the airport. Yusef let them have the room for a while, and for next to no money, after other hotels had told them they would have to pay for a full night. That's the kind of guy I want to give my business to.

Many many thanks to Yousuf, Ebru and Omit( hope i got his spelling correct) for the best hospitality ever shown to us. They made our trip to IStanbul more than pleasant.Perfect location,clean rooms, fantastic breakfast spread,lovely cakes/cookies freshly everyday and the innumerable cups of turkish coffee makes this place the ideal holiday haven.Must go people ..

This hotel ticks all the boxes for a stay in Istanbul - right in the middle of all the action, reasonably priced, clean and tidy and an extensive breakfast to start the day off. Yusef goes out of his way to make sure that his guests have a great time - he'll tell you what to see, what not to bother with, how to get around and how to get the best deals on visiting the sights and using Istanbul's seriously good public transport system.

Firstly a HUGE thank you to the many (previous) reviewers who took the time out to post reviews. I did some research when planning for my holiday to Istanbul and after reading your positive reviews; decided to go with World Heritage Hotel. They offer an array of complimentary sumptuous cakes and melt in the mouth biscuits with beverage at reception (as standard!) which is a lovely gesture and much appreciated after a long day of touring/sightseeing, this in addition to a great breakfast selection of bread, jam, cereal, pastries, omelettes, savoury Turkish egg/cheese pancakes, cold meats, sausages etc. They also have a minibar which is replenished each and every day with a selection of drinks and water (my children were in drinks heaven!). House keeping is also carried out very well, good quality bed/VERY comfortable mattresses with linen to complement the tasteful furnishing too; bedsheets/duvet/pillow cases changed everyday (as well as slippers) and toiletries generously replenished too. There is wi-fi too which is great for keeping in contact digitally. It is situated at a prime location, minutes away (walking distance!) from all the famous landmarks such as Blue Mosque, Hippodrome, Hagia Sophia etc therefore being cost effective as you will save money on transport (as we did!). Secondly, the customer service is EXCELLENT - from the moment we arrived, we felt looked after. They were very attentive, caring and extremely helpful as well as fostering a very warm and friendly atmosphere in general. The team; Manager Yusuf, Supervisor Ebru, Fathi, Yashar, Umit & Co all worked very hard to ensure that we had a comfortable stay - we felt right at home and all felt as though we were all part of an extended family! We stayed for 5 days and their standards were unfaltering, their service faultless. Their local knowledge and insight was invaluable too in arranging our own tours. Everyday; either Yusuf or Ebru would recommend places and actually mark out the journey on maps (which would require a lot of patience as I'm hopeless with maps!), they have handy which made visiting places just that much more easier; in fact, the only thing they didn't do is accompany us to the trip (for obvious reasons!). Both my children thoroughly enjoyed their stay too, so much so - they didn't want to leave! You will not be disappointed as we weren't nor the many others. Yusuf/Ebru - many many thanks from the Rahim family, we'll definitely be staying at your hotel if we visit Istanbul again.

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights on our honeymoon and we were very impressed. From the moment we arrived in Istanbul, we felt very taken care of by World Heritage Hotel. They have pick-up service from the airport, and the moment you walk in they greet you with smiles and tell you how to get to the big tourist places, great places to eat, etc. They always have coffee and tea available as well as some yummy snacks available in the lobby as well. The rooms are small but very charming and comfortable, and they were always clean. The service is what really made this hotel spectacular. Every time you come or go, they always greet you with a smile and make sure you know where you are going or they help with suggestions. They are very genuine in their service- something we really appreciated. The buffet breakfast in the morning is delicious and they even make personal omelets for you! If we ever return to Istanbul, we would stay here again and we highly recommend it to anyone going to Istanbul!

We thoroughly enjoyed our two nights at The World Heritage hotel. Yusuf is a wonderful host so helpful and friendly, he was always prepared to spend time with you helping you plan your sightseeing for the day or helping out with any problems you may have. The staff were all really nice and friendly. The hotel was in an excellent position close to the tram, shops, restaurant, Grand Bazaar etc Yusuf supplied free drinks in the fridge in the room plus tea and homemade cakes which were available in the reception area and were delicious. The morning we had to leave for the airport before breakfast, Yusuf arranged for us to be given an early breakfast which was very nice. A lovely place to stay, I can recommend it highly.

I liked everything about the hotel everything was fantastic, the staff could be more friendly, but nothing that estragsse me to stay. The rooms are superb. Everyone should visit this hotel to be happier people

We stayed at World Heritage Hotel Istanbul because of the reviews on trip advisor, and yes they are true - Yusuf and his team could not have been more helpful and genuinely hospitable. This is not a 5 star hotel with a pool and gym its a comfortable quirky small hotel in a great central location - 5 minutes or less to the Blue Mosque - World Heritage is a hotel you want to shout about and one you will want to return to.

We stayed for 5 days and their standards were unfaltering, their service faultless. Their local knowledge and insight was invaluable too in arranging our own tours. Everyday; either Yusuf or Ebru would recommend places and actually mark out the journey on maps (which would require a lot of patience as I'm hopeless with maps!), they have handy which made visiting places just that much more easier; in fact, the only thing they didn't do is accompany us to the trip (for obvious reasons!). Both my children thoroughly enjoyed their stay too, so much so - they didn't want to leave! You will not be disappointed as we weren't nor the many others. Yusuf/Ebru - many many thanks from the Rahim family, we'll definitely be staying at your hotel if we visit Istanbul again.

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights on our honeymoon and we were very impressed. From the moment we arrived in Istanbul, we felt very taken care of by World Heritage Hotel. They have pick-up service from the airport, and the moment you walk in they greet you with smiles and tell you how to get to the big tourist places, great places to eat, etc. They always have coffee and tea available as well as some yummy snacks available in the lobby as well. The rooms are small but very charming and comfortable, and they were always clean. The service is what really made this hotel spectacular. Every time you come or go, they always greet you with a smile and make sure you know where you are going or they help with suggestions. They are very genuine in their service- something we really appreciated. The buffet breakfast in the morning is delicious and they even make personal omelets for you! If we ever return to Istanbul, we would stay here again and we highly recommend it to anyone going to Istanbul!

We thoroughly enjoyed our two nights at The World Heritage hotel. Yusuf is a wonderful host so helpful and friendly, he was always prepared to spend time with you helping you plan your sightseeing for the day or helping out with any problems you may have. The staff were all really nice and friendly. The hotel was in an excellent position close to the tram, shops, restaurant, Grand Bazaar etc Yusuf supplied free drinks in the fridge in the room plus tea and homemade cakes which were available in the reception area and were delicious. The morning we had to leave for the airport before breakfast, Yusuf arranged for us to be given an early breakfast which was very nice. A lovely place to stay, I can recommend it highly.

I liked everything about the hotel everything was fantastic, the staff could be more friendly, but nothing that estragsse me to stay. The rooms are superb. Everyone should visit this hotel to be happier people

We stayed at World Heritage Hotel Istanbul because of the reviews on trip advisor, and yes they are true - Yusuf and his team could not have been more helpful and genuinely hospitable. This is not a 5 star hotel with a pool and gym its a comfortable quirky small hotel in a great central location - 5 minutes or less to the Blue Mosque - World Heritage is a hotel you want to shout about and one you will want to return to.

My wife and I enjoyed a fabulous stay at the World Heritage Hotel, Sultanahmet, Istanbul. This is a charming boutique hotel in a great location, within a short walk from the all the attractions, shops and restaurants in the old town. The service could not have been better, the staff were very welcoming and helpful and, as others have pointed out, there is always a selection of coffee and cakes available. The hotel is also excellent value for money, you could easily pay a lot more for a hotel which is not nearly as good as the WHH. We have already recommended this hotel to friends who are thinking of visiting Istanbul.

This hotel was a great choice. Attentive and kind staff, they will offer you a cup of tea or coffee and cake everyday when you arrive from your sightseeing. Yusuf (at the reception) will take 30 minutes and explain you important things for your visit on your arrival, recommending restaurants and things to do or not to do. We followed his recommendations and everything was just great. Breakfast was very good. They will have cold soft drinks at your minibar everyday for free!

I know I'm not adding anything the others before me haven't said, but this place is truly excellent. We travel a lot, and I think I'm pretty good at finding hotels that have great locations, good value, and other important intangibles. This hotel is everything we ever could have asked for! As others have pointed out, Yusef is wonderful. And so is his staff. He is jovial, knowledgable, flexible, and he truly cares about your visit. Everyone we interacted with at the hotel really, really wanted you to love your stay there, and that's something I have yet to find in even the nicest (in terms of star ratings) hotels I've been to. As others have mentioned, he will give you maps, and outline an itinerary for you that he thinks will allow you to make the best of your stay in Istanbul. He's very knowledgable about how to get around, and offers up little shortcuts here and there to make your life easier. The hotel itself is fantastic. It is a two minute walk from the Sultanahmet tram station, which will get you basically anywhere you need to go. While it is in walking distance from most of the major attractions, it also somehow isn't in the middle of the really touristy part of the old city, which saves you from being accosted by every store and restaurant owner when you're ready to wrap up your night. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the room clean and modern. From the pictures, I thought the bathroom was a little kitchy (with the gold trim and all), but when you see it in person, you see that's it's a very thoughtfully put together accommodation. The free minibar is amazing, because elsewhere on our trip throughout Turkey and Greece, water was expensive and not easy to come by. The breakfasts are fantastic. There is no reason to have the wide selection they have - and yet they do! And they'll make you an omelette if you really want one, but just trust me and eat the menemen or cheese pie. Every afternoon or evening, when you're coming in for a recharge or to rest up for the next day, there is complimentary Turkish Tea and cakes. More often than not, they would rather make the tea for you so you can relax. And it is all very, very tasty. In additional to all of that (and I think that's enough!), at one point in our stay, there was a child just screaming in the hotel. It was during the day, not a big deal, but as we were heading out I mentioned that someone had a really unhappy child to Yusef. He explained to me that the family of five was just spending a few hours in that room until they could catch their plane. Their flight into Istanbul had been severely delayed, and it was thunderstorming outside, so the family was just looking for a place to spend a few hours to dry off and warm up until it was time to go back to the airport. Yusef let them have the room for a while, and for next to no money, after other hotels had told them they would have to pay for a full night. That's the kind of guy I want to give my business to. Room Tip: I don't think there's a bad room at this hotel, but the rooms at the back of the hotel seem... See more room tips

Many many thanks to Yousuf, Ebru and Omit( hope i got his spelling correct) for the best hospitality ever shown to us. They made our trip to IStanbul more than pleasant.Perfect location,clean rooms, fantastic breakfast spread,lovely cakes/cookies freshly everyday and the innumerable cups of turkish coffee makes this place the ideal holiday haven.Must go people ..

This hotel ticks all the boxes for a stay in Istanbul - right in the middle of all the action, reasonably priced, clean and tidy and an extensive breakfast to start the day off. Yusef goes out of his way to make sure that his guests have a great time - he'll tell you what to see, what not to bother with, how to get around and how to get the best deals on visiting the sights and using Istanbul's seriously good public transport system.

Firstly a HUGE thank you to the many (previous) reviewers who took the time out to post reviews. I did some research when planning for my holiday to Istanbul and after reading your positive reviews; decided to go with World Heritage Hotel. They offer an array of complimentary sumptuous cakes and melt in the mouth biscuits with beverage at reception (as standard!) which is a lovely gesture and much appreciated after a long day of touring/sightseeing, this in addition to a great breakfast selection of bread, jam, cereal, pastries, omelettes, savoury Turkish egg/cheese pancakes, cold meats, sausages etc. They also have a minibar which is replenished each and every day with a selection of drinks and water (my children were in drinks heaven!). House keeping is also carried out very well, good quality bed/VERY comfortable mattresses with linen to complement the tasteful furnishing too; bedsheets/duvet/pillow cases changed everyday (as well as slippers) and toiletries generously replenished too. There is wi-fi too which is great for keeping in contact digitally. It is situated at a prime location, minutes away (walking distance!) from all the famous landmarks such as Blue Mosque, Hippodrome, Hagia Sophia etc therefore being cost effective as you will save money on transport (as we did!). Secondly, the customer service is EXCELLENT - from the moment we arrived, we felt looked after. They were very attentive, caring and extremely helpful as well as fostering a very warm and friendly atmosphere in general. The team; Manager Yusuf, Supervisor Ebru, Fathi, Yashar, Umit & Co all worked very hard to ensure that we had a comfortable stay - we felt right at home and all felt as though we were all part of an extended family! We stayed for 5 days and their standards were unfaltering, their service faultless. Their local knowledge and insight was invaluable too in arranging our own tours. Everyday; either Yusuf or Ebru would recommend places and actually mark out the journey on maps (which would require a lot of patience as I'm hopeless with maps!), they have handy which made visiting places just that much more easier; in fact, the only thing they didn't do is accompany us to the trip (for obvious reasons!). Both my children thoroughly enjoyed their stay too, so much so - they didn't want to leave! You will not be disappointed as we weren't nor the many others. Yusuf/Ebru - many many thanks from the Rahim family, we'll definitely be staying at your hotel if we visit Istanbul again.
