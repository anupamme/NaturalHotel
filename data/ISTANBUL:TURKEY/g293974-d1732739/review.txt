We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun.

The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things.

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated.

The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room.

Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food.

The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun.

The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things.

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated.

The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room.

Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food.

The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun.

The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things.

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated.

The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room.

Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food.

The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun.

The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things.

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated.

The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room.

Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food.

The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun.

The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things.

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated.

The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room.

Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food.

The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun.

The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things.

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated.

The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room.

Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food.

The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun.

The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things.

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated.

The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room.

Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food.

The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun.

The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things.

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated.

The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room.

Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food.

The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun.

The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things.

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated.

The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room.

Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food.

The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun.

The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things.

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room. I would call what we had a studio sized room as we just had a window and the room was quite small for a âDeluxeâ description. Our room was on the 3rd floor. The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away. Room Tip: Ask for more detail on the delux rooms, I recommend next grade up. See more room tips

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated.

The only other downfall was that the lift is quite small and sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes for it to come back. It is only a smaller boutique hotel so this is not a huge problem. If you are looking for an authentic experience this hotel certainly provides that and the restaurant just across from the hotel has amazing authentic Turkish cuisine which is nice to sit down to after a long day knowing that your hotel is just an arm stretch away.

Staying in the heart of historic Istanbul is fabulous, but to do so in such a glorious, small hotel is even better. The rooms are magnificent and there are so many good restaurants in the street directly outside (we dined at Hatay, immediately opposite the entrance on several nights). The hotel's own restaurant has the advantage of views up the Bosphorous or back to the Hagia Sophia. The bar also has the views of Hagia Sophia. The breakfast spread sets you up very well for a day exploring this wonderful city. The hotel's location means that you can get to the main sites in a few minutes, well ahead of the crowds, which is so much better than traipsing in from Beyoglu and the other parts of hotel-rich parts of town. We got here from the airport by way of the train and tram which stops a short walk away. A very easy trip and good fun. Beware of the offer of a taxi trip back as to which currency is being quoted/used, as you can get caught for the trip costing three times what you thought it would due to a "confusion" between the currencies used.

This relatively small hotel is in a great location - walking distance to most of what you want to see. It's exquisitely clean and the room decor is lovely. We had the corner room with 2 balconies. Room was quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend.

An amazing experience due to Semih that really put a big smile on our faces. Walking distance for many attractions. The most beautiful rooms I've ever seen around. Awesome and relaxing moments in this lovely evening: two thumbs up :)) highly recommended

the room was very comfortable and clean breakfast was amazing everything was there.staff were very helpful and polite my favorite member of staff was SEMIH.rooftop restaurant has an amazing view you could see all of Istanbul .the location was great .I highly recommend this hotel

Sadly we were only here for one night but thanks primarily to the staff the stay was a memorable one. From the moment we entered we were made to feel special and appreciated. We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped but a little small. Breakfast was great with a good choice of foods. The hotel is centrally located which probably explains why there is no parking nearby.

We stayed at the Hotel Sultania on our first trip to Istanbul. We were admittedly a bit nervous, this being our first time to this large city, famous for how easy it is to get lost in. The Hotel Sultania was perfectly located within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see over the course of our stay,... Hagie Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar were all less than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, and kept that way for our entire stay as well. The staff were also excellent, and helped with all of our questions. The unexpected highlight was the breakfast in the hotel. Fantastic every day with an enormous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese and cooked food. Would definitely recommend staying this hotel to anyone.

Stayed here 3 nights. It was PERFECT. location was perfect, service was amazing, room was very nice and I loved the seating area by the window. Wifi and business center came in very handy too. It's right by some great restaurants like DÃ©jÃ  vu and within walking distance to basically all the major sites. I will stay here again next time I'm in Istanbul! Tip: if you need quiet to sleep, request a room away from the strip with restaurants. Our window was facing that strip and we had a hard time sleeping at times when people were loud. Even with this, I LOVED the hotel.

Stayed here for a short four-day citytrip, room on the fifth floor (Hammam style). While most Turkish hotels and restaurants give the uneasy feeling of being "overly friendly" for commercial reasons, at least these guys give you the feeling it's genuine and they enjoy looking afer you. The hotel itself is on the smaller side, and part of a chain of two or three hotels in the same area (they also share the pool and fitness downstairs). From check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile and friendeliness. Our room was spacious, both bathroom and sleeping accomodation. The breakfast buffet is sufficient, they try to do it a bit continental style but a rather limited choice of things. The restaurant on top (Olive) is above par when it comes to service, the food itself is good and very tasty but not Michelin-star quality. Nevertheless, I would recommend for one evening. The city offers too much taste and options to only eat in. The one downside are the trips you can book through the hotel (not the hotel's fault, but the company hosting the trips). We took the full day tour, worst tour ever. They rush you to all the landmarks, you have little time to absorb or ask questions. Felt like an Asian tourist who only have time to take pictures and then move on. Location wise you could not ask for better. In walking distance of all major landmarks, also close to tram and taxi stops.

Clean, well decorated & maintained, great breakfast, central location (but without any excessive noise). Really friendly staff - especially Hilmi who helped track down my wife's baggage after it went missing on the way into Istanbul.

A nice boutique hotel suited to couples. We stayed here for 1 week and found that the location was quite convenient with the trams located just at the bottom of the walkway. The breakfasts were amazing with a good selection of fresh produce and staff friendly and accommodating. We had a deluxe room which was clean and cosy; however I feel that for what we paid I would have like to have a balcony or view of some sort and maybe a slightly bigger room.
