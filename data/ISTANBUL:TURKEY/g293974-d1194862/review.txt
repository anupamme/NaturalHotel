One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .

The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out.

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites!

Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull.

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time.

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .

Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options.

If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast.

Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store.

Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .

This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number.

We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city.

To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast.

The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .

The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out.

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites!

Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull.

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time.

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .

Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options.

If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast.

Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store.

Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .

This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number.

We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city.

To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast.

The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

You'll be surprised to experience the most confortable stay in Tomtom Suites. Firstly, all the staffs are friendly,professional and well-balanced. Above all,Duty Manager has sense of humour and perfect information of Istanbul. So every morning he gave us some handwritten maps which were painted out by colorful marker pen. Those unique maps helped us out so much during sightseeing. Secondly,building itself! Location is very convenient to go downtown. The architecture renovated Franciscan House is quaint, interior decoration is stylish, transparent elevator is cool, spacious room relaxes us. That may be the real taste of staying samll luxury hotel. Finally, Nicole restaurant on the top floor is excellent! fabulous! wonderful! With a good view and fresh air,we enjoyed variety of fruits, bread, cheese and rare Turkish local food like pumpkin marmalade or something at breakfast. And at dinner time its cozy place changes to lively and entertaining space. Special staffs treated us with sophisticated and delicious dishes. To our happiness,main chef and pastry chef came to see us. We chose wine tasting course, that's worth a try! Anyway, we want you to try Tomtom Suites! Staying Tomtom Suites would make your trip more unforgettable! And if you were hooked on Tomtom magic, you would never come back! I bet! Room Tip: Every room is sutes .
Smoking is not arrowed entire building. See more room tips

the hotel is located in a very calm street, just in front of the italian consulate. very close to the most lively part in the european side of istambul, with many good restaurants in the vicinity and ease of access to the tophane station of the tram (10 min walk). rooms are spacious and cozy, rooftop restaurant offers a very nice view of town. the staff is also a highlight for the willingness to help (nural exceeded expectations with recommendations of good restaurants and many hints for newbies in turkey like us). definitely recommended!

This is the place to stay! Everything about Tomtom Suites was fabulous. The hotel was beautiful, the location great and the staff was terrific. I can't say enough about how great our stay here was. Nural was absolutely the best. He was so friendly and he took the time everyday to give us excellent suggestions for dinner, neighborhood walking and everything in between. After long days touring the city we all looked forward to coming back to our beautiful hotel. I had left a pair of eyeglasses behind when we checked out and Nural emailed me the following day to let me know. He then arranged to have my glasses delivered to me next day delivery! Now that is what I call service! I highly recommend Tomtom Suites for your stay in Instanbul.

Great location for easy access to all Istanbul via tram, helpful staff/concierge, superb, quiet rooms. Lots of extras such as afternoon snacks, library, fantastic views of Marmara Sea. Great local restaurant , Dia Pera, just up the hill. Wonderful.

We just returned from a wonderful stay in Istanbul. This hotel is amazing. They have a wonderful rooftop breakfast each morning with many options. The afternoon tea is just what is needed after a long day of touring and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is very close to Istiklal street and public transportation. Many restaurant options nearby. But what makes this hotel exceptional is Nural. He will help you with anything you need. The only time that things went wrong is when we did not take his advice! He has wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to do in Istanbul. Nural warned us when rain was coming and even stopped by to say good bye while we were having our dinner at a restaurant that he had recommended. When we went out in a taxi, he gave us written instructions for the driver both ways including his phone number. This was very important since we do not speak Turkish and the drivers did not speak English!

Everything about this hotell was great. The location, the size/quality of the room, staff, food etc. We visited Istanbul for 8 days, and the comfort TomTom Hotell brings after some hectic days in this big city is amazing! You are taking well care of, and the hotell truly lives up to the standard as a member of small luxury hotels. The whole staff where impeccable, but I see that Nural is mentioned quite a few times, and that with good reason. Great personality and very helpfull. He made the stay a lot easier considering transport, what to see, where to look and a lot more. He even took his time off duty to have a little chat and explain the easiest way to a store. Amazing guy! We will also recommend the restaurant Nicole, situated on the 4. floor. It is certainly worth it!

One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in for quite some time. Huge rooms, lovely ambience and possibly the best Hotel Manger in Nural you will find anywhere on your travels. Nothing is too much trouble to organise. Every suggestion is a good one. The hotel location is good, the restaurant on the top floor is lovely. The only slight negative is no pool to enjoy the glorious Turkish weather but that is a very minor matter (although perhaps more so if you have kids to entertain) Simply put I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

We stayed at Tomtom twice during our recent trip to Turkey. Amazing hotel with out of this world staff. Had heard a lot about Nural. He is fabulous - the best we have come across, by far. His maps are great. He takes care of everything for you. Hotel rooms are great. Breakfast is wonderful - as are the views from the rooftop bar/restaurant. Great location in a great city. If we go back to Istanbul, this is where we are staying again.

In a land where everyone want's to sell you something you don't really need the Tomtom was a welcomed oasis. We arrived too early in the morning, yet the hotel took the extra effort to prepare our room immediately once the previous guest checked out. While waiting for housekeeping to finish their work a manager sat us down to help plan our city itinerary, then provided us with one metro pass that we could share, followed by an introduction to Turkish coffee and freshly squeezed juice ... his treat. The hotel is warm and well decorated with modern art and contemporary furniture. The rooms are very clean, well laid out, and full of little extras including a pillow menu ... always one of our favourites. The location is good and the street car is nearby which takes you everywhere in a very short period of time. When we return to Istanbul we just saved ourselves the trouble of choosing where to stay - enjoy as we did!

We enjoyed every minute. Spacious suites, interior decorated in style. Good customer service. A relatively small boutique hotel with a lot of character. Nice restaurant with great views of the Bosporus at the top. The location is also great (quite central and easy access to main avenues and transportation). However, and albeit the proximity to Istiklal, there is a steep uphill road to get there and this may be tiring on occasions.
