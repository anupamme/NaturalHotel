I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile.

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

This is a wonderful, small boutique hotel. Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile.

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

This is a wonderful, small boutique hotel. Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place.

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile.

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

This is a wonderful, small boutique hotel. Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable.

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile.

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

This is a wonderful, small boutique hotel. Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable.

However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile.

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

This is a wonderful, small boutique hotel. Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time.

I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile.

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

This is a wonderful, small boutique hotel. Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel.

It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

This is a wonderful, small boutique hotel. Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK.

It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile.

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

This is a wonderful, small boutique hotel. Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed.

While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile.

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

This is a wonderful, small boutique hotel. Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website.

I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

This is a wonderful, small boutique hotel. Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room).

I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

This is a wonderful, small boutique hotel. Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker).

It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

This is a wonderful, small boutique hotel. Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker).

It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

This is a wonderful, small boutique hotel. Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever.

Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

This is a wonderful, small boutique hotel. Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge.

The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

This is a wonderful, small boutique hotel. Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful.

Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

This is a wonderful, small boutique hotel. Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile.

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

This is a wonderful, small boutique hotel. Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

This is a wonderful, small boutique hotel. Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning!

This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

This is a wonderful, small boutique hotel. Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful.

Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

This is a wonderful, small boutique hotel. Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need.

It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips

I'm always a little nervous anticipating what a hotel will reveal on arrival, and with time off so precious it takes a while to relax. But on arrival at the Witt just after sundown on a Sunday evening we could not have been put more at ease. A genuinely welcoming reception we felt like we'd arrived at a good friends home. Two chilled glasses of white sent to the room as we unpacked... Or should I say circled the suite in awe at the beautiful design. The Cihangir neighbourhood is perfect for a bite to eat or coffee as you watch Istanbul's day unfold and the helpful team at the Witt are always available to offer another tip on where to hang out. I was excited to visit Istanbul for the first time. But have to say without Team Witt and their beautiful home it wouldn't have been half as enjoyable. A huge thank you for helping Scott to geek out at the Energy Museum. For helping me through a night of insomnia. And for a mountain of interiors ideas for our sunny Scottish flat!

I have rarely had such a flawless experience at any hotel anywhere in the world. We booked the penthouse (room 61) as we wanted a Bosphorous and Blue Mosque view and didn't want to pay the ridiculous money asked by four seasons etc. Whilst we still paid good coin the view, service and quality of the hotel more than justified the price. The wrap around balcony plus the views from inside the room were breathtaking from the penthouse. The room was also nicely appointed with a swirly funky feel with polished concrete, nice sofa area and cool bathroom. The service from Emrah, Ali and Volkan was truly welcoming. The breakfast room was just right. All I can say is the hotels that rank above Witt on TA must be amazingly good to beat Witt!!

This is a perfect boutique style hotel. It's handily located so you can walk down the road and jump on to the tram, which is the only way to get around in Istanbul. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and fall over themselves to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If you are staying in the summer time, be aware that there is no outside space, although there was some talk of creating a roof top bar, when we visited in June. To get those most out of the hotel book a room with a balcony, the rooms on the top floor are the best for views. The hotel is on a very steep road, which can finish you off after a day at the bazaar, but the convenient location makes it all worthwhile. Room Tip: Top floor or room with balcony See more room tips

OK, so I know NEVER again to use AirBnB! Suffice it to say that my two week stay in Istanbul (3rd trip) started off with a disasterous arrival at an apartment I rented through AirBnB that was unoccupiable (no a/c, no window screens!, pidgeons and mosquitoes, on the scariest street in BeyoÄlu/Taksim). It's 7pm, after 15 hours of travel. My partner is freaking out (his 1st trip to Istanbul). SO, having stayed at the Witt on my previous trip (see review May, 2012), I called and miraculously they had a room available, booked it, and hailed a taxi. Our welcome at the Witt was so gracious and Room 63 (penthouse, best view) was available! It was like we belonged there after all. I must say that I had wanted to stay at the Witt to begin with, but the original plans were for 4 other friends to meet us - ergo the apartment. Well those plans fizzled and it was just us two after all. Fortuitously. We ended up staying the entire two weeks (minus 2 mights away to Fethiye) and I must say this vacation was one of the best I've ever had. The staff (especially Volkan) are superlative! The most attentive and helpful I've ever encountered - truly making me feel as though I was staying with friends, not just at a hotel. I can not imagine ever coming to Istanbul and staying anywhere else. Every time I asked about places to go, the staff was knowledgeable, had maps and directions, and was one step ahead of me calling and researching, providing me above-and-beyond the call of duty level of information. For example, we in passing expressed an interest in Ebru (Turkish marbling/painting) and when we came back by the front desk later in the day, Volkan had the place for us to go take a class. You just don't get this level of service anywhere that I have ever experienced. The other reviews here will comment on the wonderful breakfast, room design, spotless housekeeping, the "hill" (which for me was great cardio after gorging on Turkish delights and Baklava), the view, etc., etc. I want to focus on how special and unique this hotel is, and share with you my absolute recommendation to stay here. A heartfelt thank you to everyone at the Witt for turning a disaster into a triumph. I look forward to seeing you again! Room Tip: Floor 5 and 6 for the view. See more room tips

My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. I was first drawn to the hotel by it's excellent online app which provided so much useful info on Istanbul. I decided to cancel our original res and try the Witt and that was a great decision. What loved: -enormous rooms, with kitchenette -fantastic modern decor -best free breakfast buffet of all the places we stayed in Turkey -completely accommodating staff. They lent us with an Istanbul TravelKart for trams, ferries, buses upon check in -location in the super trendy Cihangir neighborhood. Felt like the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Easy walk to great neighborhood restaurants and to the Taksim, Beyoglu areas. Easy walk to the tram to take you to the old town with all the major sites. Tram is clean and completely safe. The hotel is constructing a rooftop bar which will be great because the views from there are terrific and would add some sorely needed outdoor space.

This was my second stay at this hotel and the five-star reasons in my original review hold true. I am in the hospitality business and for me, the Witt has something authentic, simple, and genuine in its ambiance and customer service which makes it very accommodating. Now I know for sure, the next time I make a reservation for the Witt I will arrange my transit so I can add an extra day to my stay if not more.

We had the pleasure of staying for 5 nights in the king panoramic with terrace. The room looked stunning but it was the view that really made it spectacular. We really enjoyed spending time on the terrace at different times during the day. Breakfast, afternoon sun bathing and drinks before going out for the evening. The staff were brilliant and common areas also looked amazing. The only slight niggles ( and mainly because I am a fussy git) is that some of the finishes in the room could have been a little crisper so if you're looking at it from a completely high end design point you may notice this. As mentioned the hill was not good but we survived! The surrounding area was great with a plethora of stylish bars and restaurants largely frequented by locals. I would not hesitate to stay again.

I agree totally with all of the other positive reviews. Everything was great, but the highlight was the staff. Thank you to Volkan, Ali, Cagatay, Ece, Emrah, Mehmet, Aykut, and of course all of the housekeeping staff, and anyone else I'm forgetting to mention. I can't imagine returning to Istanbul and staying anywhere else.

Itâs centrally located and is around 7min walk from the main road (where the nearest tram stop is) however, do bear in mind it's a rather steep walk up the hill! If you are fit and healthy, then this is a great daily exercise after a hefty but delicious breakfast! The rooms are very spacious and equipped with everything you might need. It's very elegantly furnished and quiet. The best bit however, is the hotel staff. Every single person working at the hotel has gone out of their way to be polite to us, friendly and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I couldnât praise them enough for making us feel so welcome. The view from the hotel rooftop is simply stunning! This hotel fully deserves the praise and all the wonderful reviews. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!

This hotel has received some amazing reviews, so I'm hoping to make this one a bit more balanced so people can make an educated decision. Positives: - the staff here are absolutely wonderful. I was a difficult guest for them, having changed rooms a couple of times over our stay, and Ali went out of his way to make us as comfortable as possible. Nothing was too much to ask. Other hotels should take a leaf out of their book in terms of how customer service at a boutique hotel should be. - the penthouse suite (on the 6th floor) was absolutely incredible, as was the king panoramic suite on the 5th floor. The views of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn were magical (see comments on other rooms below). - All rooms have modern, funky decor designed by Turkish designers Autoban, great rain showers, gorgeous kitchenette and very cool rocking chair. - I loved the fact that we could have our breakfast in our room at no extra charge. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and it was a lovely, romantic touch that we could just eat our breakfast in bed. Negatives: - The king room we were originally booked into (on the 3rd floor) had nice furniture/decor, but was terribly dark and had no views whatsoever. It looked straight out into the adjacent building, and offered zero views other than into someone else's bedroom (they could obviously also see into ours - so we had to keep our curtains shut the whole time, making our room even darker). I felt deceived given that the hotel's website says, "Since the hotel is a corner building, every single room has stunning views." It says that rooms on lower floors "offer views of Istanbulâs vibrant city life" (does this mean into other people's bedrooms?). I had read the assurance of "stunning views" from "every single room" when booking, and therefore decided to book a King Room rather than a King Panoramic (had I known I would have paid more for a higher category room). I brought this to the hotel's attention, and at first they did not agree, then when I showed them the link they changed their position and said that it would clarify it on their website. I have just checked and their website has not been changed. While Ali worked hard to move us into a different room, we were first met with strong resistance and this put a very bitter taste into our mouths. - The location is just OK. It is a very, very steep walk from the tram and the main street, so I would not recommend it to old people, or anyone with a knee injury or similar. It is about 15 minutes walk from the Galata Tower and Taksim Square, but there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. There is not too much going on in the neighbourhood near the hotel. Don't be under any illusion that it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle - it feels more like a small apartment building in the outskirts, with a couple of cafes and shops here and there. - there is very little in the way of facilities here - no restaurant, pool, gym etc. Only a negative because other places of a comparable price will have all of these add ons. I am still rating this place "good" rather than "average", because if you stay in a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or Penthouse Suite, and don't mind the steep climb and a decent walk to all the sites, you will have an absolutely fantastic time. The staff do also try very hard to make you comfortable. However if you are only prepared to pay 225 euro a night, and therefore book into a Grand King room, you probably won't be wowed by this place. Room Tip: Definitely spend the extra money and book a King Panoramic, Queen Terrace or King Penthouse Room. Th... See more room tips
