This is a really "nice" hotel. The staff are warm and friendly, the decor perfect. My wife arrived back from shopping in a cab to find she only had "Old Pounds" the doorman quickly paid the cab driver and took care of the problem. The atmosphere is English, calm and understated, you don't feel as if you are in chain hotel that could be anywhere. Room Tip: Try for a junior suite See more room tips

From the moment we arrived, I knew we'd "arrived." We were very early, but they changed our original room to one that would be ready much sooner and offered us tea and biscuits in the lovely front parlor. Our room was unusual with bathroom on one level and bedroom a few steps up, but lovely bedding and decor. Loved the different pillow treats each turndown. Our breakfasts were delicious served in a charming dining room with a fireplace (no need for extra warmth in July though). The bar was so British library. I'm sorry I didn't have time for a drink there. Our favorite doorman, Stephen, made us feel safe while we watched a 25K person protest on our street. Very interesting to see something like that for us small town Texas women. If I ever get back to London I hope I can stay again at the Milestone. It is FIRST CLASS!!!

We've just returned from a lovely 3 day break in London and can highly recommend it. Giles warmly welcomed us, and there were many thoughtful touches. For example, I asked at breakfast the first day for maple syrup and it arrived on day two! Room Tip: Room service was superb. Best club sandwich I've eaten for a while See more room tips

The hotel is beautiful and the staff are outstanding. Across from Hyde Park. Consider getting the two bedroom apartment instead of two separate rooms. We will definitely stay there on our next London trip.

Thank you so much for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay with us. As you mentioned our 2 bedroom apartments are a really good option and also good value. We look forward to welcoming you back soon. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

We stayed at the Milestone the second week of July and had a wonderful experience. The location is terrific with easy access to public transportation. The hotel itself is beautiful. The service from the staff could not have been better. We hope to stay here again in the years to come.

Many thanks for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you found the location, service and facilities of the hotel to your liking and we hope to be able to welcome you back again in the near future. Kind regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We had our wedding celebration at The Milestone last weekend and it could not have been more perfect. From the welcome both we and our guests received to the delicious food, service and accommodation we would not have changed anything. The hotel is in a fabulous location opposite Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace and so has good transport links for central London as well as amazing views. We had great fun with Manvee planning the event and we very grateful to Grant and Fabrizio for putting it all together on the day and making the room look amazing. These guys accommodated our every request with no problem or question. Every staff member we came across was friendly helpful and professional. The day was finished off perfectly when we went back to our room and found rose petals scattered everywhere! We were so glad we chose the Milestone, we always felt very welcome and looked after when we visited and the whole experience was a pleasure. We will be going back there for many years to come.

I was absolutely delighted to read your kind words following your recent celebrations at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased that we met your expectations and that our team ensured everything went to plan. I have passed on your thanks to Manveer, Grant and Fabrizio plus the rest of the team. I sincerely hope that you will come and stay with us again and once again congratulations on your wedding. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

I have stayed at many 5 star hotels all over the world and The Milestone truly tops them all. My wife and I has 2 nights there on 13th and 14th August and were treated to an upgrade on arrival. The suite was beautiful and the staff couldn't do enough to help. It sounds like a cliche to say we were treated like royalty but I can think of no other way to describe it. From the doorman on our arrival, to the delightful reception ladies on check in, to Pedro who showed us around introducing us to all of the team, to the helpful concierge who arranged a car for us for an afternoon's sight seeing, to the barman who made us a special cocktail as we couldn't decide from the menu.....I could go on. The location of the hotel is literally opposite Kensington gardens and is also convenient to walk to Harrods and the main shopping area. There is simply no other hotel in London than we would consider staying at from now on.

I was absolutely delighted to read your thoughts on your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really glad to read that you enjoyed your stay and the service you received.

We recently stayed at this hotel for 3 days. The hotel is very nice, our room was perfect. The whole staff is very pleasant and friendly and knew us by name. The breakfast is excellent too! I would definitely stay there again on our next trip to London.

I was so happy to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I would also like to thank you for taking the time to write your kind words.

We had tea at the Milestone and it was fabulous. The ambiance and service were second to none. The tea was excellent and the sandwiches, cakes, and scones were beautiful and ever so tasty. I would love to stay at this lovely hotel the next time we are in London. It is an incredible property.

Thank you very much for taking the time to write your kind words following your Afternoon Tea experience at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed it and found the food service, food and facilities met your expectations. I hope that you will come and stay with us in the near future.

We just completed a 3 night family vacation at The Milestone. The hotel is quaint and decorated as a beautiful English home. Each hotel room is decorated differently. We had two rooms and one was more beautiful then the other. The breakfast buffet is great with many options. Continental which included cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit ,assorted breads and pastries or order off a full menu. The concierge planned our whole trip. Private tours, dinner and theatre tickets. Every choice was perfect! The staff all know your name the moment you arrive and can not do enough to help you. We had a sick teenager one morning and Andrea ( the concierge) personally made phone calls for us and accompanied my husband to a pharmacy. The personal service was the best we have experienced in any hotel. We can not wait to return.

I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted that you and your family liked all the facilities and service at the hotel. I was also happy to read your comments about our Concierge Andrea and how he helped you. I have passed on your kind words to him and the rest of the team. Please do come and see us again soon.

We recently stayed at this hotel for 3 days. The hotel is very nice, our room was perfect. The whole staff is very pleasant and friendly and knew us by name. The breakfast is excellent too! I would definitely stay there again on our next trip to London.

I was so happy to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I would also like to thank you for taking the time to write your kind words. I have passed these on to my team here at the hotel and we all hope to welcome you back soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We had tea at the Milestone and it was fabulous. The ambiance and service were second to none. The tea was excellent and the sandwiches, cakes, and scones were beautiful and ever so tasty. I would love to stay at this lovely hotel the next time we are in London. It is an incredible property.

Thank you very much for taking the time to write your kind words following your Afternoon Tea experience at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed it and found the food service, food and facilities met your expectations. I hope that you will come and stay with us in the near future. Kind regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We just completed a 3 night family vacation at The Milestone. The hotel is quaint and decorated as a beautiful English home. Each hotel room is decorated differently. We had two rooms and one was more beautiful then the other. The breakfast buffet is great with many options. Continental which included cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit ,assorted breads and pastries or order off a full menu. The concierge planned our whole trip. Private tours, dinner and theatre tickets. Every choice was perfect! The staff all know your name the moment you arrive and can not do enough to help you. We had a sick teenager one morning and Andrea ( the concierge) personally made phone calls for us and accompanied my husband to a pharmacy. The personal service was the best we have experienced in any hotel. We can not wait to return.

I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted that you and your family liked all the facilities and service at the hotel. I was also happy to read your comments about our Concierge Andrea and how he helped you. I have passed on your kind words to him and the rest of the team. Please do come and see us again soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

This is a really "nice" hotel. The staff are warm and friendly, the decor perfect. My wife arrived back from shopping in a cab to find she only had "Old Pounds" the doorman quickly paid the cab driver and took care of the problem. The atmosphere is English, calm and understated, you don't feel as if you are in chain hotel that could be anywhere. Room Tip: Try for a junior suite See more room tips

From the moment we arrived, I knew we'd "arrived." We were very early, but they changed our original room to one that would be ready much sooner and offered us tea and biscuits in the lovely front parlor. Our room was unusual with bathroom on one level and bedroom a few steps up, but lovely bedding and decor. Loved the different pillow treats each turndown. Our breakfasts were delicious served in a charming dining room with a fireplace (no need for extra warmth in July though). The bar was so British library. I'm sorry I didn't have time for a drink there. Our favorite doorman, Stephen, made us feel safe while we watched a 25K person protest on our street. Very interesting to see something like that for us small town Texas women. If I ever get back to London I hope I can stay again at the Milestone. It is FIRST CLASS!!!

We've just returned from a lovely 3 day break in London and can highly recommend it. Giles warmly welcomed us, and there were many thoughtful touches. For example, I asked at breakfast the first day for maple syrup and it arrived on day two! Room Tip: Room service was superb. Best club sandwich I've eaten for a while See more room tips

The hotel is beautiful and the staff are outstanding. Across from Hyde Park. Consider getting the two bedroom apartment instead of two separate rooms. We will definitely stay there on our next London trip.

Thank you so much for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay with us. As you mentioned our 2 bedroom apartments are a really good option and also good value. We look forward to welcoming you back soon. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

We stayed at the Milestone the second week of July and had a wonderful experience. The location is terrific with easy access to public transportation. The hotel itself is beautiful. The service from the staff could not have been better. We hope to stay here again in the years to come.

Many thanks for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you found the location, service and facilities of the hotel to your liking and we hope to be able to welcome you back again in the near future.

We had our wedding celebration at The Milestone last weekend and it could not have been more perfect. From the welcome both we and our guests received to the delicious food, service and accommodation we would not have changed anything. The hotel is in a fabulous location opposite Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace and so has good transport links for central London as well as amazing views. We had great fun with Manvee planning the event and we very grateful to Grant and Fabrizio for putting it all together on the day and making the room look amazing. These guys accommodated our every request with no problem or question. Every staff member we came across was friendly helpful and professional. The day was finished off perfectly when we went back to our room and found rose petals scattered everywhere! We were so glad we chose the Milestone, we always felt very welcome and looked after when we visited and the whole experience was a pleasure. We will be going back there for many years to come.

I was absolutely delighted to read your kind words following your recent celebrations at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased that we met your expectations and that our team ensured everything went to plan. I have passed on your thanks to Manveer, Grant and Fabrizio plus the rest of the team. I sincerely hope that you will come and stay with us again and once again congratulations on your wedding. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

I have stayed at many 5 star hotels all over the world and The Milestone truly tops them all. My wife and I has 2 nights there on 13th and 14th August and were treated to an upgrade on arrival. The suite was beautiful and the staff couldn't do enough to help. It sounds like a cliche to say we were treated like royalty but I can think of no other way to describe it. From the doorman on our arrival, to the delightful reception ladies on check in, to Pedro who showed us around introducing us to all of the team, to the helpful concierge who arranged a car for us for an afternoon's sight seeing, to the barman who made us a special cocktail as we couldn't decide from the menu.....I could go on. The location of the hotel is literally opposite Kensington gardens and is also convenient to walk to Harrods and the main shopping area. There is simply no other hotel in London than we would consider staying at from now on.

We had our wedding celebration at The Milestone last weekend and it could not have been more perfect. From the welcome both we and our guests received to the delicious food, service and accommodation we would not have changed anything. The hotel is in a fabulous location opposite Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace and so has good transport links for central London as well as amazing views. We had great fun with Manvee planning the event and we very grateful to Grant and Fabrizio for putting it all together on the day and making the room look amazing. These guys accommodated our every request with no problem or question. Every staff member we came across was friendly helpful and professional. The day was finished off perfectly when we went back to our room and found rose petals scattered everywhere! We were so glad we chose the Milestone, we always felt very welcome and looked after when we visited and the whole experience was a pleasure. We will be going back there for many years to come.

I was absolutely delighted to read your kind words following your recent celebrations at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased that we met your expectations and that our team ensured everything went to plan. I have passed on your thanks to Manveer, Grant and Fabrizio plus the rest of the team. I sincerely hope that you will come and stay with us again and once again congratulations on your wedding. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

I have stayed at many 5 star hotels all over the world and The Milestone truly tops them all. My wife and I has 2 nights there on 13th and 14th August and were treated to an upgrade on arrival. The suite was beautiful and the staff couldn't do enough to help. It sounds like a cliche to say we were treated like royalty but I can think of no other way to describe it. From the doorman on our arrival, to the delightful reception ladies on check in, to Pedro who showed us around introducing us to all of the team, to the helpful concierge who arranged a car for us for an afternoon's sight seeing, to the barman who made us a special cocktail as we couldn't decide from the menu.....I could go on. The location of the hotel is literally opposite Kensington gardens and is also convenient to walk to Harrods and the main shopping area. There is simply no other hotel in London than we would consider staying at from now on.

I was absolutely delighted to read your thoughts on your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really glad to read that you enjoyed your stay and the service you received. I have passed on your kind words to Pedro and to the rest of the team. Many thanks for taking the time to write your review and we hope to be able to welcome you back in the near future. Kind regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We recently stayed at this hotel for 3 days. The hotel is very nice, our room was perfect. The whole staff is very pleasant and friendly and knew us by name. The breakfast is excellent too! I would definitely stay there again on our next trip to London.

I was so happy to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I would also like to thank you for taking the time to write your kind words. I have passed these on to my team here at the hotel and we all hope to welcome you back soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We had tea at the Milestone and it was fabulous. The ambiance and service were second to none. The tea was excellent and the sandwiches, cakes, and scones were beautiful and ever so tasty. I would love to stay at this lovely hotel the next time we are in London. It is an incredible property.

Thank you very much for taking the time to write your kind words following your Afternoon Tea experience at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed it and found the food service, food and facilities met your expectations. I hope that you will come and stay with us in the near future. Kind regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We just completed a 3 night family vacation at The Milestone. The hotel is quaint and decorated as a beautiful English home. Each hotel room is decorated differently. We had two rooms and one was more beautiful then the other. The breakfast buffet is great with many options. Continental which included cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit ,assorted breads and pastries or order off a full menu. The concierge planned our whole trip. Private tours, dinner and theatre tickets. Every choice was perfect! The staff all know your name the moment you arrive and can not do enough to help you. We had a sick teenager one morning and Andrea ( the concierge) personally made phone calls for us and accompanied my husband to a pharmacy. The personal service was the best we have experienced in any hotel. We can not wait to return.

I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted that you and your family liked all the facilities and service at the hotel. I was also happy to read your comments about our Concierge Andrea and how he helped you. I have passed on your kind words to him and the rest of the team. Please do come and see us again soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

This is a really "nice" hotel. The staff are warm and friendly, the decor perfect. My wife arrived back from shopping in a cab to find she only had "Old Pounds" the doorman quickly paid the cab driver and took care of the problem. The atmosphere is English, calm and understated, you don't feel as if you are in chain hotel that could be anywhere. Room Tip: Try for a junior suite See more room tips

From the moment we arrived, I knew we'd "arrived." We were very early, but they changed our original room to one that would be ready much sooner and offered us tea and biscuits in the lovely front parlor. Our room was unusual with bathroom on one level and bedroom a few steps up, but lovely bedding and decor. Loved the different pillow treats each turndown. Our breakfasts were delicious served in a charming dining room with a fireplace (no need for extra warmth in July though). The bar was so British library. I'm sorry I didn't have time for a drink there. Our favorite doorman, Stephen, made us feel safe while we watched a 25K person protest on our street. Very interesting to see something like that for us small town Texas women. If I ever get back to London I hope I can stay again at the Milestone. It is FIRST CLASS!!!

We've just returned from a lovely 3 day break in London and can highly recommend it. Giles warmly welcomed us, and there were many thoughtful touches. For example, I asked at breakfast the first day for maple syrup and it arrived on day two! Room Tip: Room service was superb. Best club sandwich I've eaten for a while See more room tips

The hotel is beautiful and the staff are outstanding. Across from Hyde Park. Consider getting the two bedroom apartment instead of two separate rooms. We will definitely stay there on our next London trip.

Thank you so much for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay with us. As you mentioned our 2 bedroom apartments are a really good option and also good value. We look forward to welcoming you back soon. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

We stayed at the Milestone the second week of July and had a wonderful experience. The location is terrific with easy access to public transportation. The hotel itself is beautiful. The service from the staff could not have been better. We hope to stay here again in the years to come.

My wife arrived back from shopping in a cab to find she only had "Old Pounds" the doorman quickly paid the cab driver and took care of the problem. The atmosphere is English, calm and understated, you don't feel as if you are in chain hotel that could be anywhere. Room Tip: Try for a junior suite See more room tips

From the moment we arrived, I knew we'd "arrived." We were very early, but they changed our original room to one that would be ready much sooner and offered us tea and biscuits in the lovely front parlor. Our room was unusual with bathroom on one level and bedroom a few steps up, but lovely bedding and decor. Loved the different pillow treats each turndown. Our breakfasts were delicious served in a charming dining room with a fireplace (no need for extra warmth in July though). The bar was so British library. I'm sorry I didn't have time for a drink there. Our favorite doorman, Stephen, made us feel safe while we watched a 25K person protest on our street. Very interesting to see something like that for us small town Texas women. If I ever get back to London I hope I can stay again at the Milestone. It is FIRST CLASS!!!

We've just returned from a lovely 3 day break in London and can highly recommend it. Giles warmly welcomed us, and there were many thoughtful touches. For example, I asked at breakfast the first day for maple syrup and it arrived on day two! Room Tip: Room service was superb. Best club sandwich I've eaten for a while See more room tips

The hotel is beautiful and the staff are outstanding. Across from Hyde Park. Consider getting the two bedroom apartment instead of two separate rooms. We will definitely stay there on our next London trip.

Thank you so much for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay with us. As you mentioned our 2 bedroom apartments are a really good option and also good value. We look forward to welcoming you back soon. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

We stayed at the Milestone the second week of July and had a wonderful experience. The location is terrific with easy access to public transportation. The hotel itself is beautiful. The service from the staff could not have been better. We hope to stay here again in the years to come.

Many thanks for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you found the location, service and facilities of the hotel to your liking and we hope to be able to welcome you back again in the near future. Kind regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We had our wedding celebration at The Milestone last weekend and it could not have been more perfect. From the welcome both we and our guests received to the delicious food, service and accommodation we would not have changed anything. The hotel is in a fabulous location opposite Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace and so has good transport links for central London as well as amazing views. We had great fun with Manvee planning the event and we very grateful to Grant and Fabrizio for putting it all together on the day and making the room look amazing. These guys accommodated our every request with no problem or question. Every staff member we came across was friendly helpful and professional. The day was finished off perfectly when we went back to our room and found rose petals scattered everywhere! We were so glad we chose the Milestone, we always felt very welcome and looked after when we visited and the whole experience was a pleasure. We will be going back there for many years to come.

I was absolutely delighted to read your kind words following your recent celebrations at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased that we met your expectations and that our team ensured everything went to plan. I have passed on your thanks to Manveer, Grant and Fabrizio plus the rest of the team. I sincerely hope that you will come and stay with us again and once again congratulations on your wedding. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

I have stayed at many 5 star hotels all over the world and The Milestone truly tops them all. My wife and I has 2 nights there on 13th and 14th August and were treated to an upgrade on arrival. The suite was beautiful and the staff couldn't do enough to help. It sounds like a cliche to say we were treated like royalty but I can think of no other way to describe it. From the doorman on our arrival, to the delightful reception ladies on check in, to Pedro who showed us around introducing us to all of the team, to the helpful concierge who arranged a car for us for an afternoon's sight seeing, to the barman who made us a special cocktail as we couldn't decide from the menu.....I could go on. The location of the hotel is literally opposite Kensington gardens and is also convenient to walk to Harrods and the main shopping area. There is simply no other hotel in London than we would consider staying at from now on.

I was absolutely delighted to read your thoughts on your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really glad to read that you enjoyed your stay and the service you received.

We recently stayed at this hotel for 3 days. The hotel is very nice, our room was perfect. The whole staff is very pleasant and friendly and knew us by name. The breakfast is excellent too! I would definitely stay there again on our next trip to London.

We had tea at the Milestone and it was fabulous. The ambiance and service were second to none. The tea was excellent and the sandwiches, cakes, and scones were beautiful and ever so tasty. I would love to stay at this lovely hotel the next time we are in London. It is an incredible property.

Thank you very much for taking the time to write your kind words following your Afternoon Tea experience at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed it and found the food service, food and facilities met your expectations. I hope that you will come and stay with us in the near future.

We just completed a 3 night family vacation at The Milestone. The hotel is quaint and decorated as a beautiful English home. Each hotel room is decorated differently. We had two rooms and one was more beautiful then the other. The breakfast buffet is great with many options. Continental which included cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit ,assorted breads and pastries or order off a full menu. The concierge planned our whole trip. Private tours, dinner and theatre tickets. Every choice was perfect! The staff all know your name the moment you arrive and can not do enough to help you. We had a sick teenager one morning and Andrea ( the concierge) personally made phone calls for us and accompanied my husband to a pharmacy. The personal service was the best we have experienced in any hotel. We can not wait to return.

I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted that you and your family liked all the facilities and service at the hotel. I was also happy to read your comments about our Concierge Andrea and how he helped you. I have passed on your kind words to him and the rest of the team. Please do come and see us again soon.

I have passed on your kind words to Pedro and to the rest of the team. Many thanks for taking the time to write your review and we hope to be able to welcome you back in the near future.

We recently stayed at this hotel for 3 days. The hotel is very nice, our room was perfect. The whole staff is very pleasant and friendly and knew us by name. The breakfast is excellent too! I would definitely stay there again on our next trip to London.

I was so happy to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I would also like to thank you for taking the time to write your kind words. I have passed these on to my team here at the hotel and we all hope to welcome you back soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We had tea at the Milestone and it was fabulous. The ambiance and service were second to none. The tea was excellent and the sandwiches, cakes, and scones were beautiful and ever so tasty. I would love to stay at this lovely hotel the next time we are in London. It is an incredible property.

Thank you very much for taking the time to write your kind words following your Afternoon Tea experience at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed it and found the food service, food and facilities met your expectations. I hope that you will come and stay with us in the near future. Kind regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We just completed a 3 night family vacation at The Milestone. The hotel is quaint and decorated as a beautiful English home. Each hotel room is decorated differently. We had two rooms and one was more beautiful then the other. The breakfast buffet is great with many options. Continental which included cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit ,assorted breads and pastries or order off a full menu. The concierge planned our whole trip. Private tours, dinner and theatre tickets. Every choice was perfect! The staff all know your name the moment you arrive and can not do enough to help you. We had a sick teenager one morning and Andrea ( the concierge) personally made phone calls for us and accompanied my husband to a pharmacy. The personal service was the best we have experienced in any hotel. We can not wait to return.

I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted that you and your family liked all the facilities and service at the hotel. I was also happy to read your comments about our Concierge Andrea and how he helped you. I have passed on your kind words to him and the rest of the team. Please do come and see us again soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

This is a really "nice" hotel. The staff are warm and friendly, the decor perfect. My wife arrived back from shopping in a cab to find she only had "Old Pounds" the doorman quickly paid the cab driver and took care of the problem. The atmosphere is English, calm and understated, you don't feel as if you are in chain hotel that could be anywhere. Room Tip: Try for a junior suite See more room tips

From the moment we arrived, I knew we'd "arrived." We were very early, but they changed our original room to one that would be ready much sooner and offered us tea and biscuits in the lovely front parlor. Our room was unusual with bathroom on one level and bedroom a few steps up, but lovely bedding and decor. Loved the different pillow treats each turndown. Our breakfasts were delicious served in a charming dining room with a fireplace (no need for extra warmth in July though). The bar was so British library. I'm sorry I didn't have time for a drink there. Our favorite doorman, Stephen, made us feel safe while we watched a 25K person protest on our street. Very interesting to see something like that for us small town Texas women. If I ever get back to London I hope I can stay again at the Milestone. It is FIRST CLASS!!!

We've just returned from a lovely 3 day break in London and can highly recommend it. Giles warmly welcomed us, and there were many thoughtful touches. For example, I asked at breakfast the first day for maple syrup and it arrived on day two! Room Tip: Room service was superb. Best club sandwich I've eaten for a while See more room tips

The hotel is beautiful and the staff are outstanding. Across from Hyde Park. Consider getting the two bedroom apartment instead of two separate rooms. We will definitely stay there on our next London trip.

Thank you so much for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay with us. As you mentioned our 2 bedroom apartments are a really good option and also good value. We look forward to welcoming you back soon. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

We stayed at the Milestone the second week of July and had a wonderful experience. The location is terrific with easy access to public transportation. The hotel itself is beautiful. The service from the staff could not have been better. We hope to stay here again in the years to come.

Many thanks for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you found the location, service and facilities of the hotel to your liking and we hope to be able to welcome you back again in the near future.

We had our wedding celebration at The Milestone last weekend and it could not have been more perfect. From the welcome both we and our guests received to the delicious food, service and accommodation we would not have changed anything. The hotel is in a fabulous location opposite Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace and so has good transport links for central London as well as amazing views. We had great fun with Manvee planning the event and we very grateful to Grant and Fabrizio for putting it all together on the day and making the room look amazing. These guys accommodated our every request with no problem or question. Every staff member we came across was friendly helpful and professional. The day was finished off perfectly when we went back to our room and found rose petals scattered everywhere! We were so glad we chose the Milestone, we always felt very welcome and looked after when we visited and the whole experience was a pleasure. We will be going back there for many years to come.

I was absolutely delighted to read your kind words following your recent celebrations at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased that we met your expectations and that our team ensured everything went to plan. I have passed on your thanks to Manveer, Grant and Fabrizio plus the rest of the team. I sincerely hope that you will come and stay with us again and once again congratulations on your wedding. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

I have stayed at many 5 star hotels all over the world and The Milestone truly tops them all. My wife and I has 2 nights there on 13th and 14th August and were treated to an upgrade on arrival. The suite was beautiful and the staff couldn't do enough to help. It sounds like a cliche to say we were treated like royalty but I can think of no other way to describe it. From the doorman on our arrival, to the delightful reception ladies on check in, to Pedro who showed us around introducing us to all of the team, to the helpful concierge who arranged a car for us for an afternoon's sight seeing, to the barman who made us a special cocktail as we couldn't decide from the menu.....I could go on. The location of the hotel is literally opposite Kensington gardens and is also convenient to walk to Harrods and the main shopping area. There is simply no other hotel in London than we would consider staying at from now on.

I was really pleased to read that you found the location, service and facilities of the hotel to your liking and we hope to be able to welcome you back again in the near future. Kind regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We had our wedding celebration at The Milestone last weekend and it could not have been more perfect. From the welcome both we and our guests received to the delicious food, service and accommodation we would not have changed anything. The hotel is in a fabulous location opposite Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace and so has good transport links for central London as well as amazing views. We had great fun with Manvee planning the event and we very grateful to Grant and Fabrizio for putting it all together on the day and making the room look amazing. These guys accommodated our every request with no problem or question. Every staff member we came across was friendly helpful and professional. The day was finished off perfectly when we went back to our room and found rose petals scattered everywhere! We were so glad we chose the Milestone, we always felt very welcome and looked after when we visited and the whole experience was a pleasure. We will be going back there for many years to come.

I was absolutely delighted to read your kind words following your recent celebrations at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased that we met your expectations and that our team ensured everything went to plan. I have passed on your thanks to Manveer, Grant and Fabrizio plus the rest of the team. I sincerely hope that you will come and stay with us again and once again congratulations on your wedding. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

I have stayed at many 5 star hotels all over the world and The Milestone truly tops them all. My wife and I has 2 nights there on 13th and 14th August and were treated to an upgrade on arrival. The suite was beautiful and the staff couldn't do enough to help. It sounds like a cliche to say we were treated like royalty but I can think of no other way to describe it. From the doorman on our arrival, to the delightful reception ladies on check in, to Pedro who showed us around introducing us to all of the team, to the helpful concierge who arranged a car for us for an afternoon's sight seeing, to the barman who made us a special cocktail as we couldn't decide from the menu.....I could go on. The location of the hotel is literally opposite Kensington gardens and is also convenient to walk to Harrods and the main shopping area. There is simply no other hotel in London than we would consider staying at from now on.

I was absolutely delighted to read your thoughts on your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really glad to read that you enjoyed your stay and the service you received. I have passed on your kind words to Pedro and to the rest of the team. Many thanks for taking the time to write your review and we hope to be able to welcome you back in the near future.

We recently stayed at this hotel for 3 days. The hotel is very nice, our room was perfect. The whole staff is very pleasant and friendly and knew us by name. The breakfast is excellent too! I would definitely stay there again on our next trip to London.

I was so happy to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I would also like to thank you for taking the time to write your kind words. I have passed these on to my team here at the hotel and we all hope to welcome you back soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We had tea at the Milestone and it was fabulous. The ambiance and service were second to none. The tea was excellent and the sandwiches, cakes, and scones were beautiful and ever so tasty. I would love to stay at this lovely hotel the next time we are in London. It is an incredible property.

Thank you very much for taking the time to write your kind words following your Afternoon Tea experience at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed it and found the food service, food and facilities met your expectations. I hope that you will come and stay with us in the near future. Kind regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We just completed a 3 night family vacation at The Milestone. The hotel is quaint and decorated as a beautiful English home. Each hotel room is decorated differently. We had two rooms and one was more beautiful then the other. The breakfast buffet is great with many options. Continental which included cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit ,assorted breads and pastries or order off a full menu. The concierge planned our whole trip. Private tours, dinner and theatre tickets. Every choice was perfect! The staff all know your name the moment you arrive and can not do enough to help you. We had a sick teenager one morning and Andrea ( the concierge) personally made phone calls for us and accompanied my husband to a pharmacy. The personal service was the best we have experienced in any hotel. We can not wait to return.

I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted that you and your family liked all the facilities and service at the hotel. I was also happy to read your comments about our Concierge Andrea and how he helped you. I have passed on your kind words to him and the rest of the team. Please do come and see us again soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

This is a really "nice" hotel. The staff are warm and friendly, the decor perfect. My wife arrived back from shopping in a cab to find she only had "Old Pounds" the doorman quickly paid the cab driver and took care of the problem. The atmosphere is English, calm and understated, you don't feel as if you are in chain hotel that could be anywhere. Room Tip: Try for a junior suite See more room tips

From the moment we arrived, I knew we'd "arrived." We were very early, but they changed our original room to one that would be ready much sooner and offered us tea and biscuits in the lovely front parlor. Our room was unusual with bathroom on one level and bedroom a few steps up, but lovely bedding and decor. Loved the different pillow treats each turndown. Our breakfasts were delicious served in a charming dining room with a fireplace (no need for extra warmth in July though). The bar was so British library. I'm sorry I didn't have time for a drink there. Our favorite doorman, Stephen, made us feel safe while we watched a 25K person protest on our street. Very interesting to see something like that for us small town Texas women. If I ever get back to London I hope I can stay again at the Milestone. It is FIRST CLASS!!!

We've just returned from a lovely 3 day break in London and can highly recommend it. Giles warmly welcomed us, and there were many thoughtful touches. For example, I asked at breakfast the first day for maple syrup and it arrived on day two! Room Tip: Room service was superb. Best club sandwich I've eaten for a while See more room tips

The hotel is beautiful and the staff are outstanding. Across from Hyde Park. Consider getting the two bedroom apartment instead of two separate rooms. We will definitely stay there on our next London trip.

Thank you so much for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay with us. As you mentioned our 2 bedroom apartments are a really good option and also good value. We look forward to welcoming you back soon. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

I was also happy to read your comments about our Concierge Andrea and how he helped you. I have passed on your kind words to him and the rest of the team. Please do come and see us again soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

This is a really "nice" hotel. The staff are warm and friendly, the decor perfect. My wife arrived back from shopping in a cab to find she only had "Old Pounds" the doorman quickly paid the cab driver and took care of the problem. The atmosphere is English, calm and understated, you don't feel as if you are in chain hotel that could be anywhere. Room Tip: Try for a junior suite See more room tips

From the moment we arrived, I knew we'd "arrived." We were very early, but they changed our original room to one that would be ready much sooner and offered us tea and biscuits in the lovely front parlor. Our room was unusual with bathroom on one level and bedroom a few steps up, but lovely bedding and decor. Loved the different pillow treats each turndown. Our breakfasts were delicious served in a charming dining room with a fireplace (no need for extra warmth in July though). The bar was so British library. I'm sorry I didn't have time for a drink there. Our favorite doorman, Stephen, made us feel safe while we watched a 25K person protest on our street. Very interesting to see something like that for us small town Texas women. If I ever get back to London I hope I can stay again at the Milestone. It is FIRST CLASS!!!

We've just returned from a lovely 3 day break in London and can highly recommend it. Giles warmly welcomed us, and there were many thoughtful touches. For example, I asked at breakfast the first day for maple syrup and it arrived on day two! Room Tip: Room service was superb. Best club sandwich I've eaten for a while See more room tips

The hotel is beautiful and the staff are outstanding. Across from Hyde Park. Consider getting the two bedroom apartment instead of two separate rooms. We will definitely stay there on our next London trip.

Thank you so much for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay with us. As you mentioned our 2 bedroom apartments are a really good option and also good value. We look forward to welcoming you back soon. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

We stayed at the Milestone the second week of July and had a wonderful experience. The location is terrific with easy access to public transportation. The hotel itself is beautiful. The service from the staff could not have been better. We hope to stay here again in the years to come.

Many thanks for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you found the location, service and facilities of the hotel to your liking and we hope to be able to welcome you back again in the near future. Kind regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We had our wedding celebration at The Milestone last weekend and it could not have been more perfect. From the welcome both we and our guests received to the delicious food, service and accommodation we would not have changed anything. The hotel is in a fabulous location opposite Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace and so has good transport links for central London as well as amazing views. We had great fun with Manvee planning the event and we very grateful to Grant and Fabrizio for putting it all together on the day and making the room look amazing. These guys accommodated our every request with no problem or question. Every staff member we came across was friendly helpful and professional. The day was finished off perfectly when we went back to our room and found rose petals scattered everywhere! We were so glad we chose the Milestone, we always felt very welcome and looked after when we visited and the whole experience was a pleasure. We will be going back there for many years to come.

I was absolutely delighted to read your kind words following your recent celebrations at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased that we met your expectations and that our team ensured everything went to plan. I have passed on your thanks to Manveer, Grant and Fabrizio plus the rest of the team. I sincerely hope that you will come and stay with us again and once again congratulations on your wedding. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

I have stayed at many 5 star hotels all over the world and The Milestone truly tops them all. My wife and I has 2 nights there on 13th and 14th August and were treated to an upgrade on arrival. The suite was beautiful and the staff couldn't do enough to help. It sounds like a cliche to say we were treated like royalty but I can think of no other way to describe it. From the doorman on our arrival, to the delightful reception ladies on check in, to Pedro who showed us around introducing us to all of the team, to the helpful concierge who arranged a car for us for an afternoon's sight seeing, to the barman who made us a special cocktail as we couldn't decide from the menu.....I could go on. The location of the hotel is literally opposite Kensington gardens and is also convenient to walk to Harrods and the main shopping area. There is simply no other hotel in London than we would consider staying at from now on.

I was absolutely delighted to read your thoughts on your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really glad to read that you enjoyed your stay and the service you received.

We recently stayed at this hotel for 3 days. The hotel is very nice, our room was perfect. The whole staff is very pleasant and friendly and knew us by name. The breakfast is excellent too! I would definitely stay there again on our next trip to London.

We had tea at the Milestone and it was fabulous. The ambiance and service were second to none. The tea was excellent and the sandwiches, cakes, and scones were beautiful and ever so tasty. I would love to stay at this lovely hotel the next time we are in London. It is an incredible property.

Thank you very much for taking the time to write your kind words following your Afternoon Tea experience at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed it and found the food service, food and facilities met your expectations. I hope that you will come and stay with us in the near future.

We just completed a 3 night family vacation at The Milestone. The hotel is quaint and decorated as a beautiful English home. Each hotel room is decorated differently. We had two rooms and one was more beautiful then the other. The breakfast buffet is great with many options. Continental which included cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit ,assorted breads and pastries or order off a full menu. The concierge planned our whole trip. Private tours, dinner and theatre tickets. Every choice was perfect! The staff all know your name the moment you arrive and can not do enough to help you. We had a sick teenager one morning and Andrea ( the concierge) personally made phone calls for us and accompanied my husband to a pharmacy. The personal service was the best we have experienced in any hotel. We can not wait to return.

The location of the hotel is literally opposite Kensington gardens and is also convenient to walk to Harrods and the main shopping area. There is simply no other hotel in London than we would consider staying at from now on.

I was absolutely delighted to read your thoughts on your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really glad to read that you enjoyed your stay and the service you received. I have passed on your kind words to Pedro and to the rest of the team. Many thanks for taking the time to write your review and we hope to be able to welcome you back in the near future. Kind regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We recently stayed at this hotel for 3 days. The hotel is very nice, our room was perfect. The whole staff is very pleasant and friendly and knew us by name. The breakfast is excellent too! I would definitely stay there again on our next trip to London.

I was so happy to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I would also like to thank you for taking the time to write your kind words. I have passed these on to my team here at the hotel and we all hope to welcome you back soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We had tea at the Milestone and it was fabulous. The ambiance and service were second to none. The tea was excellent and the sandwiches, cakes, and scones were beautiful and ever so tasty. I would love to stay at this lovely hotel the next time we are in London. It is an incredible property.

Thank you very much for taking the time to write your kind words following your Afternoon Tea experience at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed it and found the food service, food and facilities met your expectations. I hope that you will come and stay with us in the near future. Kind regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We just completed a 3 night family vacation at The Milestone. The hotel is quaint and decorated as a beautiful English home. Each hotel room is decorated differently. We had two rooms and one was more beautiful then the other. The breakfast buffet is great with many options. Continental which included cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit ,assorted breads and pastries or order off a full menu. The concierge planned our whole trip. Private tours, dinner and theatre tickets. Every choice was perfect! The staff all know your name the moment you arrive and can not do enough to help you. We had a sick teenager one morning and Andrea ( the concierge) personally made phone calls for us and accompanied my husband to a pharmacy. The personal service was the best we have experienced in any hotel. We can not wait to return.

I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted that you and your family liked all the facilities and service at the hotel. I was also happy to read your comments about our Concierge Andrea and how he helped you. I have passed on your kind words to him and the rest of the team. Please do come and see us again soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

This is a really "nice" hotel. The staff are warm and friendly, the decor perfect. My wife arrived back from shopping in a cab to find she only had "Old Pounds" the doorman quickly paid the cab driver and took care of the problem. The atmosphere is English, calm and understated, you don't feel as if you are in chain hotel that could be anywhere. Room Tip: Try for a junior suite See more room tips

From the moment we arrived, I knew we'd "arrived." We were very early, but they changed our original room to one that would be ready much sooner and offered us tea and biscuits in the lovely front parlor. Our room was unusual with bathroom on one level and bedroom a few steps up, but lovely bedding and decor. Loved the different pillow treats each turndown. Our breakfasts were delicious served in a charming dining room with a fireplace (no need for extra warmth in July though). The bar was so British library. I'm sorry I didn't have time for a drink there. Our favorite doorman, Stephen, made us feel safe while we watched a 25K person protest on our street. Very interesting to see something like that for us small town Texas women. If I ever get back to London I hope I can stay again at the Milestone. It is FIRST CLASS!!!

We've just returned from a lovely 3 day break in London and can highly recommend it. Giles warmly welcomed us, and there were many thoughtful touches. For example, I asked at breakfast the first day for maple syrup and it arrived on day two! Room Tip: Room service was superb. Best club sandwich I've eaten for a while See more room tips

The hotel is beautiful and the staff are outstanding. Across from Hyde Park. Consider getting the two bedroom apartment instead of two separate rooms. We will definitely stay there on our next London trip.

Thank you so much for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay with us. As you mentioned our 2 bedroom apartments are a really good option and also good value. We look forward to welcoming you back soon. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

We stayed at the Milestone the second week of July and had a wonderful experience. The location is terrific with easy access to public transportation. The hotel itself is beautiful. The service from the staff could not have been better. We hope to stay here again in the years to come.

Many thanks for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you found the location, service and facilities of the hotel to your liking and we hope to be able to welcome you back again in the near future.

We had our wedding celebration at The Milestone last weekend and it could not have been more perfect. From the welcome both we and our guests received to the delicious food, service and accommodation we would not have changed anything. The hotel is in a fabulous location opposite Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace and so has good transport links for central London as well as amazing views. We had great fun with Manvee planning the event and we very grateful to Grant and Fabrizio for putting it all together on the day and making the room look amazing. These guys accommodated our every request with no problem or question. Every staff member we came across was friendly helpful and professional. The day was finished off perfectly when we went back to our room and found rose petals scattered everywhere! We were so glad we chose the Milestone, we always felt very welcome and looked after when we visited and the whole experience was a pleasure. We will be going back there for many years to come.

I was absolutely delighted to read your kind words following your recent celebrations at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased that we met your expectations and that our team ensured everything went to plan. I have passed on your thanks to Manveer, Grant and Fabrizio plus the rest of the team. I sincerely hope that you will come and stay with us again and once again congratulations on your wedding. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

I have stayed at many 5 star hotels all over the world and The Milestone truly tops them all. My wife and I has 2 nights there on 13th and 14th August and were treated to an upgrade on arrival.

Thank you so much for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay with us. As you mentioned our 2 bedroom apartments are a really good option and also good value. We look forward to welcoming you back soon. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

We stayed at the Milestone the second week of July and had a wonderful experience. The location is terrific with easy access to public transportation. The hotel itself is beautiful. The service from the staff could not have been better. We hope to stay here again in the years to come.

Many thanks for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you found the location, service and facilities of the hotel to your liking and we hope to be able to welcome you back again in the near future. Kind regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We had our wedding celebration at The Milestone last weekend and it could not have been more perfect. From the welcome both we and our guests received to the delicious food, service and accommodation we would not have changed anything. The hotel is in a fabulous location opposite Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace and so has good transport links for central London as well as amazing views. We had great fun with Manvee planning the event and we very grateful to Grant and Fabrizio for putting it all together on the day and making the room look amazing. These guys accommodated our every request with no problem or question. Every staff member we came across was friendly helpful and professional. The day was finished off perfectly when we went back to our room and found rose petals scattered everywhere! We were so glad we chose the Milestone, we always felt very welcome and looked after when we visited and the whole experience was a pleasure. We will be going back there for many years to come.

I was absolutely delighted to read your kind words following your recent celebrations at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased that we met your expectations and that our team ensured everything went to plan. I have passed on your thanks to Manveer, Grant and Fabrizio plus the rest of the team. I sincerely hope that you will come and stay with us again and once again congratulations on your wedding. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

I have stayed at many 5 star hotels all over the world and The Milestone truly tops them all. My wife and I has 2 nights there on 13th and 14th August and were treated to an upgrade on arrival. The suite was beautiful and the staff couldn't do enough to help. It sounds like a cliche to say we were treated like royalty but I can think of no other way to describe it. From the doorman on our arrival, to the delightful reception ladies on check in, to Pedro who showed us around introducing us to all of the team, to the helpful concierge who arranged a car for us for an afternoon's sight seeing, to the barman who made us a special cocktail as we couldn't decide from the menu.....I could go on. The location of the hotel is literally opposite Kensington gardens and is also convenient to walk to Harrods and the main shopping area. There is simply no other hotel in London than we would consider staying at from now on.

I was absolutely delighted to read your thoughts on your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really glad to read that you enjoyed your stay and the service you received.

We recently stayed at this hotel for 3 days. The hotel is very nice, our room was perfect. The whole staff is very pleasant and friendly and knew us by name. The breakfast is excellent too! I would definitely stay there again on our next trip to London.

I was so happy to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I would also like to thank you for taking the time to write your kind words. I have passed these on to my team here at the hotel and we all hope to welcome you back soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We had tea at the Milestone and it was fabulous. The ambiance and service were second to none. The tea was excellent and the sandwiches, cakes, and scones were beautiful and ever so tasty. I would love to stay at this lovely hotel the next time we are in London. It is an incredible property.

Thank you very much for taking the time to write your kind words following your Afternoon Tea experience at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed it and found the food service, food and facilities met your expectations. I hope that you will come and stay with us in the near future.

We just completed a 3 night family vacation at The Milestone. The hotel is quaint and decorated as a beautiful English home. Each hotel room is decorated differently. We had two rooms and one was more beautiful then the other. The breakfast buffet is great with many options. Continental which included cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit ,assorted breads and pastries or order off a full menu. The concierge planned our whole trip. Private tours, dinner and theatre tickets. Every choice was perfect! The staff all know your name the moment you arrive and can not do enough to help you. We had a sick teenager one morning and Andrea ( the concierge) personally made phone calls for us and accompanied my husband to a pharmacy. The personal service was the best we have experienced in any hotel. We can not wait to return.

I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted that you and your family liked all the facilities and service at the hotel. I was also happy to read your comments about our Concierge Andrea and how he helped you. I have passed on your kind words to him and the rest of the team. Please do come and see us again soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

This is a really "nice" hotel. The staff are warm and friendly, the decor perfect. My wife arrived back from shopping in a cab to find she only had "Old Pounds" the doorman quickly paid the cab driver and took care of the problem. The atmosphere is English, calm and understated, you don't feel as if you are in chain hotel that could be anywhere. Room Tip: Try for a junior suite See more room tips

From the moment we arrived, I knew we'd "arrived." We were very early, but they changed our original room to one that would be ready much sooner and offered us tea and biscuits in the lovely front parlor. Our room was unusual with bathroom on one level and bedroom a few steps up, but lovely bedding and decor. Loved the different pillow treats each turndown. Our breakfasts were delicious served in a charming dining room with a fireplace (no need for extra warmth in July though). The bar was so British library. I'm sorry I didn't have time for a drink there. Our favorite doorman, Stephen, made us feel safe while we watched a 25K person protest on our street. Very interesting to see something like that for us small town Texas women. If I ever get back to London I hope I can stay again at the Milestone. It is FIRST CLASS!!!

We've just returned from a lovely 3 day break in London and can highly recommend it. Giles warmly welcomed us, and there were many thoughtful touches.

Continental which included cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit ,assorted breads and pastries or order off a full menu. The concierge planned our whole trip. Private tours, dinner and theatre tickets. Every choice was perfect! The staff all know your name the moment you arrive and can not do enough to help you. We had a sick teenager one morning and Andrea ( the concierge) personally made phone calls for us and accompanied my husband to a pharmacy. The personal service was the best we have experienced in any hotel. We can not wait to return.

I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted that you and your family liked all the facilities and service at the hotel. I was also happy to read your comments about our Concierge Andrea and how he helped you. I have passed on your kind words to him and the rest of the team. Please do come and see us again soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

This is a really "nice" hotel. The staff are warm and friendly, the decor perfect. My wife arrived back from shopping in a cab to find she only had "Old Pounds" the doorman quickly paid the cab driver and took care of the problem. The atmosphere is English, calm and understated, you don't feel as if you are in chain hotel that could be anywhere. Room Tip: Try for a junior suite See more room tips

From the moment we arrived, I knew we'd "arrived." We were very early, but they changed our original room to one that would be ready much sooner and offered us tea and biscuits in the lovely front parlor. Our room was unusual with bathroom on one level and bedroom a few steps up, but lovely bedding and decor. Loved the different pillow treats each turndown. Our breakfasts were delicious served in a charming dining room with a fireplace (no need for extra warmth in July though). The bar was so British library. I'm sorry I didn't have time for a drink there. Our favorite doorman, Stephen, made us feel safe while we watched a 25K person protest on our street. Very interesting to see something like that for us small town Texas women. If I ever get back to London I hope I can stay again at the Milestone. It is FIRST CLASS!!!

We've just returned from a lovely 3 day break in London and can highly recommend it. Giles warmly welcomed us, and there were many thoughtful touches. For example, I asked at breakfast the first day for maple syrup and it arrived on day two! Room Tip: Room service was superb. Best club sandwich I've eaten for a while See more room tips

The hotel is beautiful and the staff are outstanding. Across from Hyde Park. Consider getting the two bedroom apartment instead of two separate rooms. We will definitely stay there on our next London trip.

Thank you so much for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay with us. As you mentioned our 2 bedroom apartments are a really good option and also good value. We look forward to welcoming you back soon. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

We stayed at the Milestone the second week of July and had a wonderful experience. The location is terrific with easy access to public transportation. The hotel itself is beautiful. The service from the staff could not have been better. We hope to stay here again in the years to come.

Many thanks for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you found the location, service and facilities of the hotel to your liking and we hope to be able to welcome you back again in the near future. Kind regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We had our wedding celebration at The Milestone last weekend and it could not have been more perfect. From the welcome both we and our guests received to the delicious food, service and accommodation we would not have changed anything. The hotel is in a fabulous location opposite Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace and so has good transport links for central London as well as amazing views. We had great fun with Manvee planning the event and we very grateful to Grant and Fabrizio for putting it all together on the day and making the room look amazing. These guys accommodated our every request with no problem or question. Every staff member we came across was friendly helpful and professional. The day was finished off perfectly when we went back to our room and found rose petals scattered everywhere! We were so glad we chose the Milestone, we always felt very welcome and looked after when we visited and the whole experience was a pleasure. We will be going back there for many years to come.

I was absolutely delighted to read your kind words following your recent celebrations at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased that we met your expectations and that our team ensured everything went to plan. I have passed on your thanks to Manveer, Grant and Fabrizio plus the rest of the team. I sincerely hope that you will come and stay with us again and once again congratulations on your wedding. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

I have stayed at many 5 star hotels all over the world and The Milestone truly tops them all. My wife and I has 2 nights there on 13th and 14th August and were treated to an upgrade on arrival. The suite was beautiful and the staff couldn't do enough to help. It sounds like a cliche to say we were treated like royalty but I can think of no other way to describe it. From the doorman on our arrival, to the delightful reception ladies on check in, to Pedro who showed us around introducing us to all of the team, to the helpful concierge who arranged a car for us for an afternoon's sight seeing, to the barman who made us a special cocktail as we couldn't decide from the menu.....I could go on. The location of the hotel is literally opposite Kensington gardens and is also convenient to walk to Harrods and the main shopping area. There is simply no other hotel in London than we would consider staying at from now on.

I was absolutely delighted to read your thoughts on your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really glad to read that you enjoyed your stay and the service you received.

We had tea at the Milestone and it was fabulous. The ambiance and service were second to none. The tea was excellent and the sandwiches, cakes, and scones were beautiful and ever so tasty. I would love to stay at this lovely hotel the next time we are in London. It is an incredible property.

Thank you very much for taking the time to write your kind words following your Afternoon Tea experience at The Milestone Hotel.

I have stayed at many 5 star hotels all over the world and The Milestone truly tops them all. My wife and I has 2 nights there on 13th and 14th August and were treated to an upgrade on arrival. The suite was beautiful and the staff couldn't do enough to help. It sounds like a cliche to say we were treated like royalty but I can think of no other way to describe it. From the doorman on our arrival, to the delightful reception ladies on check in, to Pedro who showed us around introducing us to all of the team, to the helpful concierge who arranged a car for us for an afternoon's sight seeing, to the barman who made us a special cocktail as we couldn't decide from the menu.....I could go on. The location of the hotel is literally opposite Kensington gardens and is also convenient to walk to Harrods and the main shopping area. There is simply no other hotel in London than we would consider staying at from now on.

I was absolutely delighted to read your thoughts on your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really glad to read that you enjoyed your stay and the service you received. I have passed on your kind words to Pedro and to the rest of the team. Many thanks for taking the time to write your review and we hope to be able to welcome you back in the near future. Kind regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We recently stayed at this hotel for 3 days. The hotel is very nice, our room was perfect. The whole staff is very pleasant and friendly and knew us by name. The breakfast is excellent too! I would definitely stay there again on our next trip to London.

I was so happy to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I would also like to thank you for taking the time to write your kind words. I have passed these on to my team here at the hotel and we all hope to welcome you back soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We had tea at the Milestone and it was fabulous. The ambiance and service were second to none. The tea was excellent and the sandwiches, cakes, and scones were beautiful and ever so tasty. I would love to stay at this lovely hotel the next time we are in London. It is an incredible property.

Thank you very much for taking the time to write your kind words following your Afternoon Tea experience at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed it and found the food service, food and facilities met your expectations. I hope that you will come and stay with us in the near future. Kind regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We just completed a 3 night family vacation at The Milestone. The hotel is quaint and decorated as a beautiful English home. Each hotel room is decorated differently. We had two rooms and one was more beautiful then the other. The breakfast buffet is great with many options. Continental which included cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit ,assorted breads and pastries or order off a full menu. The concierge planned our whole trip. Private tours, dinner and theatre tickets. Every choice was perfect! The staff all know your name the moment you arrive and can not do enough to help you. We had a sick teenager one morning and Andrea ( the concierge) personally made phone calls for us and accompanied my husband to a pharmacy. The personal service was the best we have experienced in any hotel. We can not wait to return.

I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted that you and your family liked all the facilities and service at the hotel. I was also happy to read your comments about our Concierge Andrea and how he helped you. I have passed on your kind words to him and the rest of the team. Please do come and see us again soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

This is a really "nice" hotel. The staff are warm and friendly, the decor perfect. My wife arrived back from shopping in a cab to find she only had "Old Pounds" the doorman quickly paid the cab driver and took care of the problem. The atmosphere is English, calm and understated, you don't feel as if you are in chain hotel that could be anywhere. Room Tip: Try for a junior suite See more room tips

From the moment we arrived, I knew we'd "arrived." We were very early, but they changed our original room to one that would be ready much sooner and offered us tea and biscuits in the lovely front parlor. Our room was unusual with bathroom on one level and bedroom a few steps up, but lovely bedding and decor. Loved the different pillow treats each turndown. Our breakfasts were delicious served in a charming dining room with a fireplace (no need for extra warmth in July though). The bar was so British library. I'm sorry I didn't have time for a drink there. Our favorite doorman, Stephen, made us feel safe while we watched a 25K person protest on our street. Very interesting to see something like that for us small town Texas women. If I ever get back to London I hope I can stay again at the Milestone. It is FIRST CLASS!!!

We've just returned from a lovely 3 day break in London and can highly recommend it. Giles warmly welcomed us, and there were many thoughtful touches. For example, I asked at breakfast the first day for maple syrup and it arrived on day two! Room Tip: Room service was superb. Best club sandwich I've eaten for a while See more room tips

The hotel is beautiful and the staff are outstanding. Across from Hyde Park. Consider getting the two bedroom apartment instead of two separate rooms. We will definitely stay there on our next London trip.

Thank you so much for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay with us. As you mentioned our 2 bedroom apartments are a really good option and also good value. We look forward to welcoming you back soon. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

We stayed at the Milestone the second week of July and had a wonderful experience. The location is terrific with easy access to public transportation. The hotel itself is beautiful. The service from the staff could not have been better. We hope to stay here again in the years to come.

Many thanks for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel.

We had our wedding celebration at The Milestone last weekend and it could not have been more perfect. From the welcome both we and our guests received to the delicious food, service and accommodation we would not have changed anything. The hotel is in a fabulous location opposite Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace and so has good transport links for central London as well as amazing views. We had great fun with Manvee planning the event and we very grateful to Grant and Fabrizio for putting it all together on the day and making the room look amazing. These guys accommodated our every request with no problem or question. Every staff member we came across was friendly helpful and professional. The day was finished off perfectly when we went back to our room and found rose petals scattered everywhere! We were so glad we chose the Milestone, we always felt very welcome and looked after when we visited and the whole experience was a pleasure. We will be going back there for many years to come.

We've just returned from a lovely 3 day break in London and can highly recommend it. Giles warmly welcomed us, and there were many thoughtful touches. For example, I asked at breakfast the first day for maple syrup and it arrived on day two! Room Tip: Room service was superb. Best club sandwich I've eaten for a while See more room tips

The hotel is beautiful and the staff are outstanding. Across from Hyde Park. Consider getting the two bedroom apartment instead of two separate rooms. We will definitely stay there on our next London trip.

Thank you so much for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay with us. As you mentioned our 2 bedroom apartments are a really good option and also good value. We look forward to welcoming you back soon. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

We stayed at the Milestone the second week of July and had a wonderful experience. The location is terrific with easy access to public transportation. The hotel itself is beautiful. The service from the staff could not have been better. We hope to stay here again in the years to come.

Many thanks for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you found the location, service and facilities of the hotel to your liking and we hope to be able to welcome you back again in the near future. Kind regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We had our wedding celebration at The Milestone last weekend and it could not have been more perfect. From the welcome both we and our guests received to the delicious food, service and accommodation we would not have changed anything. The hotel is in a fabulous location opposite Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace and so has good transport links for central London as well as amazing views. We had great fun with Manvee planning the event and we very grateful to Grant and Fabrizio for putting it all together on the day and making the room look amazing. These guys accommodated our every request with no problem or question. Every staff member we came across was friendly helpful and professional. The day was finished off perfectly when we went back to our room and found rose petals scattered everywhere! We were so glad we chose the Milestone, we always felt very welcome and looked after when we visited and the whole experience was a pleasure. We will be going back there for many years to come.

I was absolutely delighted to read your kind words following your recent celebrations at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased that we met your expectations and that our team ensured everything went to plan. I have passed on your thanks to Manveer, Grant and Fabrizio plus the rest of the team. I sincerely hope that you will come and stay with us again and once again congratulations on your wedding. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

I have stayed at many 5 star hotels all over the world and The Milestone truly tops them all. My wife and I has 2 nights there on 13th and 14th August and were treated to an upgrade on arrival. The suite was beautiful and the staff couldn't do enough to help. It sounds like a cliche to say we were treated like royalty but I can think of no other way to describe it. From the doorman on our arrival, to the delightful reception ladies on check in, to Pedro who showed us around introducing us to all of the team, to the helpful concierge who arranged a car for us for an afternoon's sight seeing, to the barman who made us a special cocktail as we couldn't decide from the menu.....I could go on. The location of the hotel is literally opposite Kensington gardens and is also convenient to walk to Harrods and the main shopping area. There is simply no other hotel in London than we would consider staying at from now on.

I was absolutely delighted to read your thoughts on your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really glad to read that you enjoyed your stay and the service you received.

We recently stayed at this hotel for 3 days. The hotel is very nice, our room was perfect. The whole staff is very pleasant and friendly and knew us by name. The breakfast is excellent too! I would definitely stay there again on our next trip to London.

I was so happy to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I would also like to thank you for taking the time to write your kind words. I have passed these on to my team here at the hotel and we all hope to welcome you back soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We had tea at the Milestone and it was fabulous. The ambiance and service were second to none. The tea was excellent and the sandwiches, cakes, and scones were beautiful and ever so tasty. I would love to stay at this lovely hotel the next time we are in London. It is an incredible property.

Thank you very much for taking the time to write your kind words following your Afternoon Tea experience at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed it and found the food service, food and facilities met your expectations. I hope that you will come and stay with us in the near future.

We just completed a 3 night family vacation at The Milestone. The hotel is quaint and decorated as a beautiful English home. Each hotel room is decorated differently. We had two rooms and one was more beautiful then the other. The breakfast buffet is great with many options. Continental which included cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit ,assorted breads and pastries or order off a full menu. The concierge planned our whole trip. Private tours, dinner and theatre tickets. Every choice was perfect! The staff all know your name the moment you arrive and can not do enough to help you. We had a sick teenager one morning and Andrea ( the concierge) personally made phone calls for us and accompanied my husband to a pharmacy. The personal service was the best we have experienced in any hotel. We can not wait to return.

I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted that you and your family liked all the facilities and service at the hotel. I was also happy to read your comments about our Concierge Andrea and how he helped you. I have passed on your kind words to him and the rest of the team. Please do come and see us again soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

This is a really "nice" hotel. The staff are warm and friendly, the decor perfect. My wife arrived back from shopping in a cab to find she only had "Old Pounds" the doorman quickly paid the cab driver and took care of the problem. The atmosphere is English, calm and understated, you don't feel as if you are in chain hotel that could be anywhere. Room Tip: Try for a junior suite See more room tips

From the moment we arrived, I knew we'd "arrived." We were very early, but they changed our original room to one that would be ready much sooner and offered us tea and biscuits in the lovely front parlor. Our room was unusual with bathroom on one level and bedroom a few steps up, but lovely bedding and decor. Loved the different pillow treats each turndown. Our breakfasts were delicious served in a charming dining room with a fireplace (no need for extra warmth in July though). The bar was so British library. I'm sorry I didn't have time for a drink there. Our favorite doorman, Stephen, made us feel safe while we watched a 25K person protest on our street.

Thank you very much for taking the time to write your kind words following your Afternoon Tea experience at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed it and found the food service, food and facilities met your expectations. I hope that you will come and stay with us in the near future. Kind regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We just completed a 3 night family vacation at The Milestone. The hotel is quaint and decorated as a beautiful English home. Each hotel room is decorated differently. We had two rooms and one was more beautiful then the other. The breakfast buffet is great with many options. Continental which included cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit ,assorted breads and pastries or order off a full menu. The concierge planned our whole trip. Private tours, dinner and theatre tickets. Every choice was perfect! The staff all know your name the moment you arrive and can not do enough to help you. We had a sick teenager one morning and Andrea ( the concierge) personally made phone calls for us and accompanied my husband to a pharmacy. The personal service was the best we have experienced in any hotel. We can not wait to return.

I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted that you and your family liked all the facilities and service at the hotel. I was also happy to read your comments about our Concierge Andrea and how he helped you. I have passed on your kind words to him and the rest of the team. Please do come and see us again soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

This is a really "nice" hotel. The staff are warm and friendly, the decor perfect. My wife arrived back from shopping in a cab to find she only had "Old Pounds" the doorman quickly paid the cab driver and took care of the problem. The atmosphere is English, calm and understated, you don't feel as if you are in chain hotel that could be anywhere. Room Tip: Try for a junior suite See more room tips

From the moment we arrived, I knew we'd "arrived." We were very early, but they changed our original room to one that would be ready much sooner and offered us tea and biscuits in the lovely front parlor. Our room was unusual with bathroom on one level and bedroom a few steps up, but lovely bedding and decor. Loved the different pillow treats each turndown. Our breakfasts were delicious served in a charming dining room with a fireplace (no need for extra warmth in July though). The bar was so British library. I'm sorry I didn't have time for a drink there. Our favorite doorman, Stephen, made us feel safe while we watched a 25K person protest on our street. Very interesting to see something like that for us small town Texas women. If I ever get back to London I hope I can stay again at the Milestone. It is FIRST CLASS!!!

We've just returned from a lovely 3 day break in London and can highly recommend it. Giles warmly welcomed us, and there were many thoughtful touches. For example, I asked at breakfast the first day for maple syrup and it arrived on day two! Room Tip: Room service was superb. Best club sandwich I've eaten for a while See more room tips

The hotel is beautiful and the staff are outstanding. Across from Hyde Park. Consider getting the two bedroom apartment instead of two separate rooms. We will definitely stay there on our next London trip.

Thank you so much for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay with us. As you mentioned our 2 bedroom apartments are a really good option and also good value. We look forward to welcoming you back soon. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

We stayed at the Milestone the second week of July and had a wonderful experience. The location is terrific with easy access to public transportation. The hotel itself is beautiful. The service from the staff could not have been better. We hope to stay here again in the years to come.

Many thanks for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you found the location, service and facilities of the hotel to your liking and we hope to be able to welcome you back again in the near future. Kind regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We had our wedding celebration at The Milestone last weekend and it could not have been more perfect. From the welcome both we and our guests received to the delicious food, service and accommodation we would not have changed anything. The hotel is in a fabulous location opposite Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace and so has good transport links for central London as well as amazing views. We had great fun with Manvee planning the event and we very grateful to Grant and Fabrizio for putting it all together on the day and making the room look amazing. These guys accommodated our every request with no problem or question. Every staff member we came across was friendly helpful and professional. The day was finished off perfectly when we went back to our room and found rose petals scattered everywhere! We were so glad we chose the Milestone, we always felt very welcome and looked after when we visited and the whole experience was a pleasure. We will be going back there for many years to come.

I was absolutely delighted to read your kind words following your recent celebrations at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased that we met your expectations and that our team ensured everything went to plan. I have passed on your thanks to Manveer, Grant and Fabrizio plus the rest of the team. I sincerely hope that you will come and stay with us again and once again congratulations on your wedding. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

I have stayed at many 5 star hotels all over the world and The Milestone truly tops them all. My wife and I has 2 nights there on 13th and 14th August and were treated to an upgrade on arrival. The suite was beautiful and the staff couldn't do enough to help. It sounds like a cliche to say we were treated like royalty but I can think of no other way to describe it. From the doorman on our arrival, to the delightful reception ladies on check in, to Pedro who showed us around introducing us to all of the team, to the helpful concierge who arranged a car for us for an afternoon's sight seeing, to the barman who made us a special cocktail as we couldn't decide from the menu.....I could go on. The location of the hotel is literally opposite Kensington gardens and is also convenient to walk to Harrods and the main shopping area. There is simply no other hotel in London than we would consider staying at from now on.

I was absolutely delighted to read your thoughts on your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really glad to read that you enjoyed your stay and the service you received.

The day was finished off perfectly when we went back to our room and found rose petals scattered everywhere! We were so glad we chose the Milestone, we always felt very welcome and looked after when we visited and the whole experience was a pleasure. We will be going back there for many years to come.

I was absolutely delighted to read your kind words following your recent celebrations at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased that we met your expectations and that our team ensured everything went to plan. I have passed on your thanks to Manveer, Grant and Fabrizio plus the rest of the team. I sincerely hope that you will come and stay with us again and once again congratulations on your wedding. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

I have stayed at many 5 star hotels all over the world and The Milestone truly tops them all. My wife and I has 2 nights there on 13th and 14th August and were treated to an upgrade on arrival. The suite was beautiful and the staff couldn't do enough to help. It sounds like a cliche to say we were treated like royalty but I can think of no other way to describe it. From the doorman on our arrival, to the delightful reception ladies on check in, to Pedro who showed us around introducing us to all of the team, to the helpful concierge who arranged a car for us for an afternoon's sight seeing, to the barman who made us a special cocktail as we couldn't decide from the menu.....I could go on. The location of the hotel is literally opposite Kensington gardens and is also convenient to walk to Harrods and the main shopping area. There is simply no other hotel in London than we would consider staying at from now on.

I was absolutely delighted to read your thoughts on your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really glad to read that you enjoyed your stay and the service you received. I have passed on your kind words to Pedro and to the rest of the team. Many thanks for taking the time to write your review and we hope to be able to welcome you back in the near future. Kind regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We recently stayed at this hotel for 3 days. The hotel is very nice, our room was perfect. The whole staff is very pleasant and friendly and knew us by name. The breakfast is excellent too! I would definitely stay there again on our next trip to London.

I was so happy to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I would also like to thank you for taking the time to write your kind words. I have passed these on to my team here at the hotel and we all hope to welcome you back soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We had tea at the Milestone and it was fabulous. The ambiance and service were second to none. The tea was excellent and the sandwiches, cakes, and scones were beautiful and ever so tasty. I would love to stay at this lovely hotel the next time we are in London. It is an incredible property.

Thank you very much for taking the time to write your kind words following your Afternoon Tea experience at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed it and found the food service, food and facilities met your expectations. I hope that you will come and stay with us in the near future. Kind regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We just completed a 3 night family vacation at The Milestone. The hotel is quaint and decorated as a beautiful English home. Each hotel room is decorated differently. We had two rooms and one was more beautiful then the other. The breakfast buffet is great with many options. Continental which included cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit ,assorted breads and pastries or order off a full menu. The concierge planned our whole trip. Private tours, dinner and theatre tickets. Every choice was perfect! The staff all know your name the moment you arrive and can not do enough to help you. We had a sick teenager one morning and Andrea ( the concierge) personally made phone calls for us and accompanied my husband to a pharmacy. The personal service was the best we have experienced in any hotel. We can not wait to return.

I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted that you and your family liked all the facilities and service at the hotel. I was also happy to read your comments about our Concierge Andrea and how he helped you. I have passed on your kind words to him and the rest of the team. Please do come and see us again soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

This is a really "nice" hotel. The staff are warm and friendly, the decor perfect. My wife arrived back from shopping in a cab to find she only had "Old Pounds" the doorman quickly paid the cab driver and took care of the problem. The atmosphere is English, calm and understated, you don't feel as if you are in chain hotel that could be anywhere. Room Tip: Try for a junior suite See more room tips

From the moment we arrived, I knew we'd "arrived." We were very early, but they changed our original room to one that would be ready much sooner and offered us tea and biscuits in the lovely front parlor. Our room was unusual with bathroom on one level and bedroom a few steps up, but lovely bedding and decor. Loved the different pillow treats each turndown. Our breakfasts were delicious served in a charming dining room with a fireplace (no need for extra warmth in July though). The bar was so British library. I'm sorry I didn't have time for a drink there. Our favorite doorman, Stephen, made us feel safe while we watched a 25K person protest on our street. Very interesting to see something like that for us small town Texas women. If I ever get back to London I hope I can stay again at the Milestone. It is FIRST CLASS!!!

We've just returned from a lovely 3 day break in London and can highly recommend it. Giles warmly welcomed us, and there were many thoughtful touches. For example, I asked at breakfast the first day for maple syrup and it arrived on day two! Room Tip: Room service was superb. Best club sandwich I've eaten for a while See more room tips

The hotel is beautiful and the staff are outstanding. Across from Hyde Park. Consider getting the two bedroom apartment instead of two separate rooms. We will definitely stay there on our next London trip.

Thank you so much for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay with us. As you mentioned our 2 bedroom apartments are a really good option and also good value. We look forward to welcoming you back soon. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

We stayed at the Milestone the second week of July and had a wonderful experience. The location is terrific with easy access to public transportation. The hotel itself is beautiful. The service from the staff could not have been better. We hope to stay here again in the years to come.

Many thanks for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel.

We had our wedding celebration at The Milestone last weekend and it could not have been more perfect. From the welcome both we and our guests received to the delicious food, service and accommodation we would not have changed anything. The hotel is in a fabulous location opposite Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace and so has good transport links for central London as well as amazing views. We had great fun with Manvee planning the event and we very grateful to Grant and Fabrizio for putting it all together on the day and making the room look amazing.

Our room was unusual with bathroom on one level and bedroom a few steps up, but lovely bedding and decor. Loved the different pillow treats each turndown. Our breakfasts were delicious served in a charming dining room with a fireplace (no need for extra warmth in July though). The bar was so British library. I'm sorry I didn't have time for a drink there. Our favorite doorman, Stephen, made us feel safe while we watched a 25K person protest on our street. Very interesting to see something like that for us small town Texas women. If I ever get back to London I hope I can stay again at the Milestone. It is FIRST CLASS!!!

We've just returned from a lovely 3 day break in London and can highly recommend it. Giles warmly welcomed us, and there were many thoughtful touches. For example, I asked at breakfast the first day for maple syrup and it arrived on day two! Room Tip: Room service was superb. Best club sandwich I've eaten for a while See more room tips

The hotel is beautiful and the staff are outstanding. Across from Hyde Park. Consider getting the two bedroom apartment instead of two separate rooms. We will definitely stay there on our next London trip.

Thank you so much for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay with us. As you mentioned our 2 bedroom apartments are a really good option and also good value. We look forward to welcoming you back soon. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

We stayed at the Milestone the second week of July and had a wonderful experience. The location is terrific with easy access to public transportation. The hotel itself is beautiful. The service from the staff could not have been better. We hope to stay here again in the years to come.

Many thanks for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you found the location, service and facilities of the hotel to your liking and we hope to be able to welcome you back again in the near future. Kind regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We had our wedding celebration at The Milestone last weekend and it could not have been more perfect. From the welcome both we and our guests received to the delicious food, service and accommodation we would not have changed anything. The hotel is in a fabulous location opposite Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace and so has good transport links for central London as well as amazing views. We had great fun with Manvee planning the event and we very grateful to Grant and Fabrizio for putting it all together on the day and making the room look amazing. These guys accommodated our every request with no problem or question. Every staff member we came across was friendly helpful and professional. The day was finished off perfectly when we went back to our room and found rose petals scattered everywhere! We were so glad we chose the Milestone, we always felt very welcome and looked after when we visited and the whole experience was a pleasure. We will be going back there for many years to come.

I was absolutely delighted to read your kind words following your recent celebrations at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased that we met your expectations and that our team ensured everything went to plan. I have passed on your thanks to Manveer, Grant and Fabrizio plus the rest of the team. I sincerely hope that you will come and stay with us again and once again congratulations on your wedding. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

I have stayed at many 5 star hotels all over the world and The Milestone truly tops them all. My wife and I has 2 nights there on 13th and 14th August and were treated to an upgrade on arrival. The suite was beautiful and the staff couldn't do enough to help. It sounds like a cliche to say we were treated like royalty but I can think of no other way to describe it. From the doorman on our arrival, to the delightful reception ladies on check in, to Pedro who showed us around introducing us to all of the team, to the helpful concierge who arranged a car for us for an afternoon's sight seeing, to the barman who made us a special cocktail as we couldn't decide from the menu.....I could go on. The location of the hotel is literally opposite Kensington gardens and is also convenient to walk to Harrods and the main shopping area. There is simply no other hotel in London than we would consider staying at from now on.

I was absolutely delighted to read your thoughts on your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really glad to read that you enjoyed your stay and the service you received.

We recently stayed at this hotel for 3 days. The hotel is very nice, our room was perfect. The whole staff is very pleasant and friendly and knew us by name. The breakfast is excellent too! I would definitely stay there again on our next trip to London.

I was so happy to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I would also like to thank you for taking the time to write your kind words.

We had tea at the Milestone and it was fabulous. The ambiance and service were second to none. The tea was excellent and the sandwiches, cakes, and scones were beautiful and ever so tasty. I would love to stay at this lovely hotel the next time we are in London. It is an incredible property.

Thank you very much for taking the time to write your kind words following your Afternoon Tea experience at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed it and found the food service, food and facilities met your expectations. I hope that you will come and stay with us in the near future.

We just completed a 3 night family vacation at The Milestone. The hotel is quaint and decorated as a beautiful English home. Each hotel room is decorated differently. We had two rooms and one was more beautiful then the other. The breakfast buffet is great with many options. Continental which included cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit ,assorted breads and pastries or order off a full menu. The concierge planned our whole trip. Private tours, dinner and theatre tickets. Every choice was perfect! The staff all know your name the moment you arrive and can not do enough to help you. We had a sick teenager one morning and Andrea ( the concierge) personally made phone calls for us and accompanied my husband to a pharmacy. The personal service was the best we have experienced in any hotel. We can not wait to return.

I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted that you and your family liked all the facilities and service at the hotel. I was also happy to read your comments about our Concierge Andrea and how he helped you. I have passed on your kind words to him and the rest of the team. Please do come and see us again soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

This is a really "nice" hotel. The staff are warm and friendly, the decor perfect. My wife arrived back from shopping in a cab to find she only had "Old Pounds" the doorman quickly paid the cab driver and took care of the problem. The atmosphere is English, calm and understated, you don't feel as if you are in chain hotel that could be anywhere. Room Tip: Try for a junior suite See more room tips

I have passed these on to my team here at the hotel and we all hope to welcome you back soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We had tea at the Milestone and it was fabulous. The ambiance and service were second to none. The tea was excellent and the sandwiches, cakes, and scones were beautiful and ever so tasty. I would love to stay at this lovely hotel the next time we are in London. It is an incredible property.

Thank you very much for taking the time to write your kind words following your Afternoon Tea experience at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed it and found the food service, food and facilities met your expectations. I hope that you will come and stay with us in the near future. Kind regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We just completed a 3 night family vacation at The Milestone. The hotel is quaint and decorated as a beautiful English home. Each hotel room is decorated differently. We had two rooms and one was more beautiful then the other. The breakfast buffet is great with many options. Continental which included cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit ,assorted breads and pastries or order off a full menu. The concierge planned our whole trip. Private tours, dinner and theatre tickets. Every choice was perfect! The staff all know your name the moment you arrive and can not do enough to help you. We had a sick teenager one morning and Andrea ( the concierge) personally made phone calls for us and accompanied my husband to a pharmacy. The personal service was the best we have experienced in any hotel. We can not wait to return.

I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted that you and your family liked all the facilities and service at the hotel. I was also happy to read your comments about our Concierge Andrea and how he helped you. I have passed on your kind words to him and the rest of the team. Please do come and see us again soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

This is a really "nice" hotel. The staff are warm and friendly, the decor perfect. My wife arrived back from shopping in a cab to find she only had "Old Pounds" the doorman quickly paid the cab driver and took care of the problem. The atmosphere is English, calm and understated, you don't feel as if you are in chain hotel that could be anywhere. Room Tip: Try for a junior suite See more room tips

From the moment we arrived, I knew we'd "arrived." We were very early, but they changed our original room to one that would be ready much sooner and offered us tea and biscuits in the lovely front parlor. Our room was unusual with bathroom on one level and bedroom a few steps up, but lovely bedding and decor. Loved the different pillow treats each turndown. Our breakfasts were delicious served in a charming dining room with a fireplace (no need for extra warmth in July though). The bar was so British library. I'm sorry I didn't have time for a drink there. Our favorite doorman, Stephen, made us feel safe while we watched a 25K person protest on our street. Very interesting to see something like that for us small town Texas women. If I ever get back to London I hope I can stay again at the Milestone. It is FIRST CLASS!!!

We've just returned from a lovely 3 day break in London and can highly recommend it. Giles warmly welcomed us, and there were many thoughtful touches. For example, I asked at breakfast the first day for maple syrup and it arrived on day two! Room Tip: Room service was superb. Best club sandwich I've eaten for a while See more room tips

The hotel is beautiful and the staff are outstanding. Across from Hyde Park. Consider getting the two bedroom apartment instead of two separate rooms. We will definitely stay there on our next London trip.

Thank you so much for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay with us. As you mentioned our 2 bedroom apartments are a really good option and also good value. We look forward to welcoming you back soon. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

We stayed at the Milestone the second week of July and had a wonderful experience. The location is terrific with easy access to public transportation. The hotel itself is beautiful. The service from the staff could not have been better. We hope to stay here again in the years to come.

Many thanks for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you found the location, service and facilities of the hotel to your liking and we hope to be able to welcome you back again in the near future.

We had our wedding celebration at The Milestone last weekend and it could not have been more perfect. From the welcome both we and our guests received to the delicious food, service and accommodation we would not have changed anything. The hotel is in a fabulous location opposite Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace and so has good transport links for central London as well as amazing views. We had great fun with Manvee planning the event and we very grateful to Grant and Fabrizio for putting it all together on the day and making the room look amazing. These guys accommodated our every request with no problem or question. Every staff member we came across was friendly helpful and professional. The day was finished off perfectly when we went back to our room and found rose petals scattered everywhere! We were so glad we chose the Milestone, we always felt very welcome and looked after when we visited and the whole experience was a pleasure. We will be going back there for many years to come.

I was absolutely delighted to read your kind words following your recent celebrations at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased that we met your expectations and that our team ensured everything went to plan. I have passed on your thanks to Manveer, Grant and Fabrizio plus the rest of the team. I sincerely hope that you will come and stay with us again and once again congratulations on your wedding. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

I have stayed at many 5 star hotels all over the world and The Milestone truly tops them all. My wife and I has 2 nights there on 13th and 14th August and were treated to an upgrade on arrival. The suite was beautiful and the staff couldn't do enough to help. It sounds like a cliche to say we were treated like royalty but I can think of no other way to describe it. From the doorman on our arrival, to the delightful reception ladies on check in, to Pedro who showed us around introducing us to all of the team, to the helpful concierge who arranged a car for us for an afternoon's sight seeing, to the barman who made us a special cocktail as we couldn't decide from the menu.....I could go on. The location of the hotel is literally opposite Kensington gardens and is also convenient to walk to Harrods and the main shopping area. There is simply no other hotel in London than we would consider staying at from now on.

I was absolutely delighted to read your thoughts on your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really glad to read that you enjoyed your stay and the service you received.

The hotel is in a fabulous location opposite Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace and so has good transport links for central London as well as amazing views. We had great fun with Manvee planning the event and we very grateful to Grant and Fabrizio for putting it all together on the day and making the room look amazing. These guys accommodated our every request with no problem or question. Every staff member we came across was friendly helpful and professional. The day was finished off perfectly when we went back to our room and found rose petals scattered everywhere! We were so glad we chose the Milestone, we always felt very welcome and looked after when we visited and the whole experience was a pleasure. We will be going back there for many years to come.

I was absolutely delighted to read your kind words following your recent celebrations at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased that we met your expectations and that our team ensured everything went to plan. I have passed on your thanks to Manveer, Grant and Fabrizio plus the rest of the team. I sincerely hope that you will come and stay with us again and once again congratulations on your wedding. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

I have stayed at many 5 star hotels all over the world and The Milestone truly tops them all. My wife and I has 2 nights there on 13th and 14th August and were treated to an upgrade on arrival. The suite was beautiful and the staff couldn't do enough to help. It sounds like a cliche to say we were treated like royalty but I can think of no other way to describe it. From the doorman on our arrival, to the delightful reception ladies on check in, to Pedro who showed us around introducing us to all of the team, to the helpful concierge who arranged a car for us for an afternoon's sight seeing, to the barman who made us a special cocktail as we couldn't decide from the menu.....I could go on. The location of the hotel is literally opposite Kensington gardens and is also convenient to walk to Harrods and the main shopping area. There is simply no other hotel in London than we would consider staying at from now on.

I was absolutely delighted to read your thoughts on your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really glad to read that you enjoyed your stay and the service you received. I have passed on your kind words to Pedro and to the rest of the team. Many thanks for taking the time to write your review and we hope to be able to welcome you back in the near future. Kind regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We recently stayed at this hotel for 3 days. The hotel is very nice, our room was perfect. The whole staff is very pleasant and friendly and knew us by name. The breakfast is excellent too! I would definitely stay there again on our next trip to London.

I was so happy to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I would also like to thank you for taking the time to write your kind words. I have passed these on to my team here at the hotel and we all hope to welcome you back soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We had tea at the Milestone and it was fabulous. The ambiance and service were second to none. The tea was excellent and the sandwiches, cakes, and scones were beautiful and ever so tasty. I would love to stay at this lovely hotel the next time we are in London. It is an incredible property.

Thank you very much for taking the time to write your kind words following your Afternoon Tea experience at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed it and found the food service, food and facilities met your expectations. I hope that you will come and stay with us in the near future. Kind regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We just completed a 3 night family vacation at The Milestone. The hotel is quaint and decorated as a beautiful English home. Each hotel room is decorated differently. We had two rooms and one was more beautiful then the other. The breakfast buffet is great with many options. Continental which included cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit ,assorted breads and pastries or order off a full menu. The concierge planned our whole trip. Private tours, dinner and theatre tickets. Every choice was perfect! The staff all know your name the moment you arrive and can not do enough to help you. We had a sick teenager one morning and Andrea ( the concierge) personally made phone calls for us and accompanied my husband to a pharmacy. The personal service was the best we have experienced in any hotel. We can not wait to return.

I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted that you and your family liked all the facilities and service at the hotel. I was also happy to read your comments about our Concierge Andrea and how he helped you. I have passed on your kind words to him and the rest of the team. Please do come and see us again soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

This is a really "nice" hotel. The staff are warm and friendly, the decor perfect. My wife arrived back from shopping in a cab to find she only had "Old Pounds" the doorman quickly paid the cab driver and took care of the problem. The atmosphere is English, calm and understated, you don't feel as if you are in chain hotel that could be anywhere. Room Tip: Try for a junior suite See more room tips

From the moment we arrived, I knew we'd "arrived." We were very early, but they changed our original room to one that would be ready much sooner and offered us tea and biscuits in the lovely front parlor. Our room was unusual with bathroom on one level and bedroom a few steps up, but lovely bedding and decor. Loved the different pillow treats each turndown. Our breakfasts were delicious served in a charming dining room with a fireplace (no need for extra warmth in July though). The bar was so British library. I'm sorry I didn't have time for a drink there. Our favorite doorman, Stephen, made us feel safe while we watched a 25K person protest on our street. Very interesting to see something like that for us small town Texas women. If I ever get back to London I hope I can stay again at the Milestone. It is FIRST CLASS!!!

We've just returned from a lovely 3 day break in London and can highly recommend it. Giles warmly welcomed us, and there were many thoughtful touches. For example, I asked at breakfast the first day for maple syrup and it arrived on day two! Room Tip: Room service was superb. Best club sandwich I've eaten for a while See more room tips

The hotel is beautiful and the staff are outstanding. Across from Hyde Park. Consider getting the two bedroom apartment instead of two separate rooms. We will definitely stay there on our next London trip.

Thank you so much for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay with us. As you mentioned our 2 bedroom apartments are a really good option and also good value. We look forward to welcoming you back soon. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

We stayed at the Milestone the second week of July and had a wonderful experience. The location is terrific with easy access to public transportation. The hotel itself is beautiful. The service from the staff could not have been better. We hope to stay here again in the years to come.

The atmosphere is English, calm and understated, you don't feel as if you are in chain hotel that could be anywhere. Room Tip: Try for a junior suite See more room tips

From the moment we arrived, I knew we'd "arrived." We were very early, but they changed our original room to one that would be ready much sooner and offered us tea and biscuits in the lovely front parlor. Our room was unusual with bathroom on one level and bedroom a few steps up, but lovely bedding and decor. Loved the different pillow treats each turndown. Our breakfasts were delicious served in a charming dining room with a fireplace (no need for extra warmth in July though). The bar was so British library. I'm sorry I didn't have time for a drink there. Our favorite doorman, Stephen, made us feel safe while we watched a 25K person protest on our street. Very interesting to see something like that for us small town Texas women. If I ever get back to London I hope I can stay again at the Milestone. It is FIRST CLASS!!!

We've just returned from a lovely 3 day break in London and can highly recommend it. Giles warmly welcomed us, and there were many thoughtful touches. For example, I asked at breakfast the first day for maple syrup and it arrived on day two! Room Tip: Room service was superb. Best club sandwich I've eaten for a while See more room tips

The hotel is beautiful and the staff are outstanding. Across from Hyde Park. Consider getting the two bedroom apartment instead of two separate rooms. We will definitely stay there on our next London trip.

Thank you so much for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay with us. As you mentioned our 2 bedroom apartments are a really good option and also good value. We look forward to welcoming you back soon. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

We stayed at the Milestone the second week of July and had a wonderful experience. The location is terrific with easy access to public transportation. The hotel itself is beautiful. The service from the staff could not have been better. We hope to stay here again in the years to come.

Many thanks for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you found the location, service and facilities of the hotel to your liking and we hope to be able to welcome you back again in the near future. Kind regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We had our wedding celebration at The Milestone last weekend and it could not have been more perfect. From the welcome both we and our guests received to the delicious food, service and accommodation we would not have changed anything. The hotel is in a fabulous location opposite Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace and so has good transport links for central London as well as amazing views. We had great fun with Manvee planning the event and we very grateful to Grant and Fabrizio for putting it all together on the day and making the room look amazing. These guys accommodated our every request with no problem or question. Every staff member we came across was friendly helpful and professional. The day was finished off perfectly when we went back to our room and found rose petals scattered everywhere! We were so glad we chose the Milestone, we always felt very welcome and looked after when we visited and the whole experience was a pleasure. We will be going back there for many years to come.

I was absolutely delighted to read your kind words following your recent celebrations at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased that we met your expectations and that our team ensured everything went to plan. I have passed on your thanks to Manveer, Grant and Fabrizio plus the rest of the team. I sincerely hope that you will come and stay with us again and once again congratulations on your wedding. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

I have stayed at many 5 star hotels all over the world and The Milestone truly tops them all. My wife and I has 2 nights there on 13th and 14th August and were treated to an upgrade on arrival. The suite was beautiful and the staff couldn't do enough to help. It sounds like a cliche to say we were treated like royalty but I can think of no other way to describe it. From the doorman on our arrival, to the delightful reception ladies on check in, to Pedro who showed us around introducing us to all of the team, to the helpful concierge who arranged a car for us for an afternoon's sight seeing, to the barman who made us a special cocktail as we couldn't decide from the menu.....I could go on. The location of the hotel is literally opposite Kensington gardens and is also convenient to walk to Harrods and the main shopping area. There is simply no other hotel in London than we would consider staying at from now on.

I was absolutely delighted to read your thoughts on your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really glad to read that you enjoyed your stay and the service you received.

We recently stayed at this hotel for 3 days. The hotel is very nice, our room was perfect. The whole staff is very pleasant and friendly and knew us by name. The breakfast is excellent too! I would definitely stay there again on our next trip to London.

I was so happy to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I would also like to thank you for taking the time to write your kind words.

We had tea at the Milestone and it was fabulous. The ambiance and service were second to none. The tea was excellent and the sandwiches, cakes, and scones were beautiful and ever so tasty. I would love to stay at this lovely hotel the next time we are in London. It is an incredible property.

Thank you very much for taking the time to write your kind words following your Afternoon Tea experience at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed it and found the food service, food and facilities met your expectations. I hope that you will come and stay with us in the near future.

We just completed a 3 night family vacation at The Milestone. The hotel is quaint and decorated as a beautiful English home. Each hotel room is decorated differently. We had two rooms and one was more beautiful then the other. The breakfast buffet is great with many options. Continental which included cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit ,assorted breads and pastries or order off a full menu. The concierge planned our whole trip. Private tours, dinner and theatre tickets. Every choice was perfect! The staff all know your name the moment you arrive and can not do enough to help you. We had a sick teenager one morning and Andrea ( the concierge) personally made phone calls for us and accompanied my husband to a pharmacy. The personal service was the best we have experienced in any hotel. We can not wait to return.

I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted that you and your family liked all the facilities and service at the hotel. I was also happy to read your comments about our Concierge Andrea and how he helped you. I have passed on your kind words to him and the rest of the team. Please do come and see us again soon.

We recently stayed at this hotel for 3 days. The hotel is very nice, our room was perfect. The whole staff is very pleasant and friendly and knew us by name. The breakfast is excellent too! I would definitely stay there again on our next trip to London.

I was so happy to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I would also like to thank you for taking the time to write your kind words. I have passed these on to my team here at the hotel and we all hope to welcome you back soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We had tea at the Milestone and it was fabulous. The ambiance and service were second to none. The tea was excellent and the sandwiches, cakes, and scones were beautiful and ever so tasty. I would love to stay at this lovely hotel the next time we are in London. It is an incredible property.

Thank you very much for taking the time to write your kind words following your Afternoon Tea experience at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed it and found the food service, food and facilities met your expectations. I hope that you will come and stay with us in the near future. Kind regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We just completed a 3 night family vacation at The Milestone. The hotel is quaint and decorated as a beautiful English home. Each hotel room is decorated differently. We had two rooms and one was more beautiful then the other. The breakfast buffet is great with many options. Continental which included cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit ,assorted breads and pastries or order off a full menu. The concierge planned our whole trip. Private tours, dinner and theatre tickets. Every choice was perfect! The staff all know your name the moment you arrive and can not do enough to help you. We had a sick teenager one morning and Andrea ( the concierge) personally made phone calls for us and accompanied my husband to a pharmacy. The personal service was the best we have experienced in any hotel. We can not wait to return.

I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted that you and your family liked all the facilities and service at the hotel. I was also happy to read your comments about our Concierge Andrea and how he helped you. I have passed on your kind words to him and the rest of the team. Please do come and see us again soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

This is a really "nice" hotel. The staff are warm and friendly, the decor perfect. My wife arrived back from shopping in a cab to find she only had "Old Pounds" the doorman quickly paid the cab driver and took care of the problem. The atmosphere is English, calm and understated, you don't feel as if you are in chain hotel that could be anywhere. Room Tip: Try for a junior suite See more room tips

From the moment we arrived, I knew we'd "arrived." We were very early, but they changed our original room to one that would be ready much sooner and offered us tea and biscuits in the lovely front parlor. Our room was unusual with bathroom on one level and bedroom a few steps up, but lovely bedding and decor. Loved the different pillow treats each turndown. Our breakfasts were delicious served in a charming dining room with a fireplace (no need for extra warmth in July though). The bar was so British library. I'm sorry I didn't have time for a drink there. Our favorite doorman, Stephen, made us feel safe while we watched a 25K person protest on our street. Very interesting to see something like that for us small town Texas women. If I ever get back to London I hope I can stay again at the Milestone. It is FIRST CLASS!!!

We've just returned from a lovely 3 day break in London and can highly recommend it. Giles warmly welcomed us, and there were many thoughtful touches. For example, I asked at breakfast the first day for maple syrup and it arrived on day two! Room Tip: Room service was superb. Best club sandwich I've eaten for a while See more room tips

The hotel is beautiful and the staff are outstanding. Across from Hyde Park. Consider getting the two bedroom apartment instead of two separate rooms. We will definitely stay there on our next London trip.

Thank you so much for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay with us. As you mentioned our 2 bedroom apartments are a really good option and also good value. We look forward to welcoming you back soon. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

We stayed at the Milestone the second week of July and had a wonderful experience. The location is terrific with easy access to public transportation. The hotel itself is beautiful. The service from the staff could not have been better. We hope to stay here again in the years to come.

Many thanks for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you found the location, service and facilities of the hotel to your liking and we hope to be able to welcome you back again in the near future.

We had our wedding celebration at The Milestone last weekend and it could not have been more perfect. From the welcome both we and our guests received to the delicious food, service and accommodation we would not have changed anything. The hotel is in a fabulous location opposite Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace and so has good transport links for central London as well as amazing views. We had great fun with Manvee planning the event and we very grateful to Grant and Fabrizio for putting it all together on the day and making the room look amazing. These guys accommodated our every request with no problem or question. Every staff member we came across was friendly helpful and professional. The day was finished off perfectly when we went back to our room and found rose petals scattered everywhere! We were so glad we chose the Milestone, we always felt very welcome and looked after when we visited and the whole experience was a pleasure. We will be going back there for many years to come.

I was absolutely delighted to read your kind words following your recent celebrations at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased that we met your expectations and that our team ensured everything went to plan. I have passed on your thanks to Manveer, Grant and Fabrizio plus the rest of the team. I sincerely hope that you will come and stay with us again and once again congratulations on your wedding. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

I have stayed at many 5 star hotels all over the world and The Milestone truly tops them all. My wife and I has 2 nights there on 13th and 14th August and were treated to an upgrade on arrival. The suite was beautiful and the staff couldn't do enough to help. It sounds like a cliche to say we were treated like royalty but I can think of no other way to describe it. From the doorman on our arrival, to the delightful reception ladies on check in, to Pedro who showed us around introducing us to all of the team, to the helpful concierge who arranged a car for us for an afternoon's sight seeing, to the barman who made us a special cocktail as we couldn't decide from the menu.....I could go on. The location of the hotel is literally opposite Kensington gardens and is also convenient to walk to Harrods and the main shopping area. There is simply no other hotel in London than we would consider staying at from now on.

We had our wedding celebration at The Milestone last weekend and it could not have been more perfect. From the welcome both we and our guests received to the delicious food, service and accommodation we would not have changed anything. The hotel is in a fabulous location opposite Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace and so has good transport links for central London as well as amazing views. We had great fun with Manvee planning the event and we very grateful to Grant and Fabrizio for putting it all together on the day and making the room look amazing. These guys accommodated our every request with no problem or question. Every staff member we came across was friendly helpful and professional. The day was finished off perfectly when we went back to our room and found rose petals scattered everywhere! We were so glad we chose the Milestone, we always felt very welcome and looked after when we visited and the whole experience was a pleasure. We will be going back there for many years to come.

I was absolutely delighted to read your kind words following your recent celebrations at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased that we met your expectations and that our team ensured everything went to plan. I have passed on your thanks to Manveer, Grant and Fabrizio plus the rest of the team. I sincerely hope that you will come and stay with us again and once again congratulations on your wedding. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

I have stayed at many 5 star hotels all over the world and The Milestone truly tops them all. My wife and I has 2 nights there on 13th and 14th August and were treated to an upgrade on arrival. The suite was beautiful and the staff couldn't do enough to help. It sounds like a cliche to say we were treated like royalty but I can think of no other way to describe it. From the doorman on our arrival, to the delightful reception ladies on check in, to Pedro who showed us around introducing us to all of the team, to the helpful concierge who arranged a car for us for an afternoon's sight seeing, to the barman who made us a special cocktail as we couldn't decide from the menu.....I could go on. The location of the hotel is literally opposite Kensington gardens and is also convenient to walk to Harrods and the main shopping area. There is simply no other hotel in London than we would consider staying at from now on.

I was absolutely delighted to read your thoughts on your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really glad to read that you enjoyed your stay and the service you received. I have passed on your kind words to Pedro and to the rest of the team. Many thanks for taking the time to write your review and we hope to be able to welcome you back in the near future. Kind regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We recently stayed at this hotel for 3 days. The hotel is very nice, our room was perfect. The whole staff is very pleasant and friendly and knew us by name. The breakfast is excellent too! I would definitely stay there again on our next trip to London.

I was so happy to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I would also like to thank you for taking the time to write your kind words. I have passed these on to my team here at the hotel and we all hope to welcome you back soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We had tea at the Milestone and it was fabulous. The ambiance and service were second to none. The tea was excellent and the sandwiches, cakes, and scones were beautiful and ever so tasty. I would love to stay at this lovely hotel the next time we are in London. It is an incredible property.

Thank you very much for taking the time to write your kind words following your Afternoon Tea experience at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed it and found the food service, food and facilities met your expectations. I hope that you will come and stay with us in the near future. Kind regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We just completed a 3 night family vacation at The Milestone. The hotel is quaint and decorated as a beautiful English home. Each hotel room is decorated differently. We had two rooms and one was more beautiful then the other. The breakfast buffet is great with many options. Continental which included cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit ,assorted breads and pastries or order off a full menu. The concierge planned our whole trip. Private tours, dinner and theatre tickets. Every choice was perfect! The staff all know your name the moment you arrive and can not do enough to help you. We had a sick teenager one morning and Andrea ( the concierge) personally made phone calls for us and accompanied my husband to a pharmacy. The personal service was the best we have experienced in any hotel. We can not wait to return.

I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted that you and your family liked all the facilities and service at the hotel. I was also happy to read your comments about our Concierge Andrea and how he helped you. I have passed on your kind words to him and the rest of the team. Please do come and see us again soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

This is a really "nice" hotel. The staff are warm and friendly, the decor perfect. My wife arrived back from shopping in a cab to find she only had "Old Pounds" the doorman quickly paid the cab driver and took care of the problem. The atmosphere is English, calm and understated, you don't feel as if you are in chain hotel that could be anywhere. Room Tip: Try for a junior suite See more room tips

From the moment we arrived, I knew we'd "arrived." We were very early, but they changed our original room to one that would be ready much sooner and offered us tea and biscuits in the lovely front parlor. Our room was unusual with bathroom on one level and bedroom a few steps up, but lovely bedding and decor. Loved the different pillow treats each turndown. Our breakfasts were delicious served in a charming dining room with a fireplace (no need for extra warmth in July though). The bar was so British library. I'm sorry I didn't have time for a drink there. Our favorite doorman, Stephen, made us feel safe while we watched a 25K person protest on our street. Very interesting to see something like that for us small town Texas women. If I ever get back to London I hope I can stay again at the Milestone. It is FIRST CLASS!!!

We've just returned from a lovely 3 day break in London and can highly recommend it. Giles warmly welcomed us, and there were many thoughtful touches. For example, I asked at breakfast the first day for maple syrup and it arrived on day two! Room Tip: Room service was superb. Best club sandwich I've eaten for a while See more room tips

The hotel is beautiful and the staff are outstanding. Across from Hyde Park. Consider getting the two bedroom apartment instead of two separate rooms. We will definitely stay there on our next London trip.

Thank you so much for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay with us. As you mentioned our 2 bedroom apartments are a really good option and also good value. We look forward to welcoming you back soon. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

We stayed at the Milestone the second week of July and had a wonderful experience. The location is terrific with easy access to public transportation. The hotel itself is beautiful. The service from the staff could not have been better. We hope to stay here again in the years to come.

My wife arrived back from shopping in a cab to find she only had "Old Pounds" the doorman quickly paid the cab driver and took care of the problem. The atmosphere is English, calm and understated, you don't feel as if you are in chain hotel that could be anywhere. Room Tip: Try for a junior suite See more room tips

From the moment we arrived, I knew we'd "arrived." We were very early, but they changed our original room to one that would be ready much sooner and offered us tea and biscuits in the lovely front parlor. Our room was unusual with bathroom on one level and bedroom a few steps up, but lovely bedding and decor. Loved the different pillow treats each turndown. Our breakfasts were delicious served in a charming dining room with a fireplace (no need for extra warmth in July though). The bar was so British library. I'm sorry I didn't have time for a drink there. Our favorite doorman, Stephen, made us feel safe while we watched a 25K person protest on our street. Very interesting to see something like that for us small town Texas women. If I ever get back to London I hope I can stay again at the Milestone. It is FIRST CLASS!!!

We've just returned from a lovely 3 day break in London and can highly recommend it. Giles warmly welcomed us, and there were many thoughtful touches. For example, I asked at breakfast the first day for maple syrup and it arrived on day two! Room Tip: Room service was superb. Best club sandwich I've eaten for a while See more room tips

The hotel is beautiful and the staff are outstanding. Across from Hyde Park. Consider getting the two bedroom apartment instead of two separate rooms. We will definitely stay there on our next London trip.

Thank you so much for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay with us. As you mentioned our 2 bedroom apartments are a really good option and also good value. We look forward to welcoming you back soon. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

We stayed at the Milestone the second week of July and had a wonderful experience. The location is terrific with easy access to public transportation. The hotel itself is beautiful. The service from the staff could not have been better. We hope to stay here again in the years to come.

Many thanks for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you found the location, service and facilities of the hotel to your liking and we hope to be able to welcome you back again in the near future. Kind regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We had our wedding celebration at The Milestone last weekend and it could not have been more perfect. From the welcome both we and our guests received to the delicious food, service and accommodation we would not have changed anything. The hotel is in a fabulous location opposite Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace and so has good transport links for central London as well as amazing views. We had great fun with Manvee planning the event and we very grateful to Grant and Fabrizio for putting it all together on the day and making the room look amazing. These guys accommodated our every request with no problem or question. Every staff member we came across was friendly helpful and professional. The day was finished off perfectly when we went back to our room and found rose petals scattered everywhere! We were so glad we chose the Milestone, we always felt very welcome and looked after when we visited and the whole experience was a pleasure. We will be going back there for many years to come.

I was absolutely delighted to read your kind words following your recent celebrations at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased that we met your expectations and that our team ensured everything went to plan. I have passed on your thanks to Manveer, Grant and Fabrizio plus the rest of the team. I sincerely hope that you will come and stay with us again and once again congratulations on your wedding. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

I have stayed at many 5 star hotels all over the world and The Milestone truly tops them all. My wife and I has 2 nights there on 13th and 14th August and were treated to an upgrade on arrival. The suite was beautiful and the staff couldn't do enough to help. It sounds like a cliche to say we were treated like royalty but I can think of no other way to describe it. From the doorman on our arrival, to the delightful reception ladies on check in, to Pedro who showed us around introducing us to all of the team, to the helpful concierge who arranged a car for us for an afternoon's sight seeing, to the barman who made us a special cocktail as we couldn't decide from the menu.....I could go on. The location of the hotel is literally opposite Kensington gardens and is also convenient to walk to Harrods and the main shopping area. There is simply no other hotel in London than we would consider staying at from now on.

I was absolutely delighted to read your thoughts on your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really glad to read that you enjoyed your stay and the service you received.

We recently stayed at this hotel for 3 days. The hotel is very nice, our room was perfect. The whole staff is very pleasant and friendly and knew us by name. The breakfast is excellent too! I would definitely stay there again on our next trip to London.

We had tea at the Milestone and it was fabulous. The ambiance and service were second to none. The tea was excellent and the sandwiches, cakes, and scones were beautiful and ever so tasty. I would love to stay at this lovely hotel the next time we are in London. It is an incredible property.

Thank you very much for taking the time to write your kind words following your Afternoon Tea experience at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed it and found the food service, food and facilities met your expectations. I hope that you will come and stay with us in the near future.

We just completed a 3 night family vacation at The Milestone. The hotel is quaint and decorated as a beautiful English home. Each hotel room is decorated differently. We had two rooms and one was more beautiful then the other. The breakfast buffet is great with many options. Continental which included cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit ,assorted breads and pastries or order off a full menu. The concierge planned our whole trip. Private tours, dinner and theatre tickets. Every choice was perfect! The staff all know your name the moment you arrive and can not do enough to help you. We had a sick teenager one morning and Andrea ( the concierge) personally made phone calls for us and accompanied my husband to a pharmacy. The personal service was the best we have experienced in any hotel. We can not wait to return.

I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted that you and your family liked all the facilities and service at the hotel. I was also happy to read your comments about our Concierge Andrea and how he helped you. I have passed on your kind words to him and the rest of the team. Please do come and see us again soon.

I have passed on your kind words to Pedro and to the rest of the team. Many thanks for taking the time to write your review and we hope to be able to welcome you back in the near future.

We recently stayed at this hotel for 3 days. The hotel is very nice, our room was perfect. The whole staff is very pleasant and friendly and knew us by name. The breakfast is excellent too! I would definitely stay there again on our next trip to London.

I was so happy to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I would also like to thank you for taking the time to write your kind words. I have passed these on to my team here at the hotel and we all hope to welcome you back soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We had tea at the Milestone and it was fabulous. The ambiance and service were second to none. The tea was excellent and the sandwiches, cakes, and scones were beautiful and ever so tasty. I would love to stay at this lovely hotel the next time we are in London. It is an incredible property.

Thank you very much for taking the time to write your kind words following your Afternoon Tea experience at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed it and found the food service, food and facilities met your expectations. I hope that you will come and stay with us in the near future. Kind regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We just completed a 3 night family vacation at The Milestone. The hotel is quaint and decorated as a beautiful English home. Each hotel room is decorated differently. We had two rooms and one was more beautiful then the other. The breakfast buffet is great with many options. Continental which included cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit ,assorted breads and pastries or order off a full menu. The concierge planned our whole trip. Private tours, dinner and theatre tickets. Every choice was perfect! The staff all know your name the moment you arrive and can not do enough to help you. We had a sick teenager one morning and Andrea ( the concierge) personally made phone calls for us and accompanied my husband to a pharmacy. The personal service was the best we have experienced in any hotel. We can not wait to return.

I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted that you and your family liked all the facilities and service at the hotel. I was also happy to read your comments about our Concierge Andrea and how he helped you. I have passed on your kind words to him and the rest of the team. Please do come and see us again soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

This is a really "nice" hotel. The staff are warm and friendly, the decor perfect. My wife arrived back from shopping in a cab to find she only had "Old Pounds" the doorman quickly paid the cab driver and took care of the problem. The atmosphere is English, calm and understated, you don't feel as if you are in chain hotel that could be anywhere. Room Tip: Try for a junior suite See more room tips

From the moment we arrived, I knew we'd "arrived." We were very early, but they changed our original room to one that would be ready much sooner and offered us tea and biscuits in the lovely front parlor. Our room was unusual with bathroom on one level and bedroom a few steps up, but lovely bedding and decor. Loved the different pillow treats each turndown. Our breakfasts were delicious served in a charming dining room with a fireplace (no need for extra warmth in July though). The bar was so British library. I'm sorry I didn't have time for a drink there. Our favorite doorman, Stephen, made us feel safe while we watched a 25K person protest on our street. Very interesting to see something like that for us small town Texas women. If I ever get back to London I hope I can stay again at the Milestone. It is FIRST CLASS!!!

We've just returned from a lovely 3 day break in London and can highly recommend it. Giles warmly welcomed us, and there were many thoughtful touches. For example, I asked at breakfast the first day for maple syrup and it arrived on day two! Room Tip: Room service was superb. Best club sandwich I've eaten for a while See more room tips

The hotel is beautiful and the staff are outstanding. Across from Hyde Park. Consider getting the two bedroom apartment instead of two separate rooms. We will definitely stay there on our next London trip.

Thank you so much for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay with us. As you mentioned our 2 bedroom apartments are a really good option and also good value. We look forward to welcoming you back soon. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

We stayed at the Milestone the second week of July and had a wonderful experience. The location is terrific with easy access to public transportation. The hotel itself is beautiful. The service from the staff could not have been better. We hope to stay here again in the years to come.

Many thanks for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you found the location, service and facilities of the hotel to your liking and we hope to be able to welcome you back again in the near future.

We had our wedding celebration at The Milestone last weekend and it could not have been more perfect. From the welcome both we and our guests received to the delicious food, service and accommodation we would not have changed anything. The hotel is in a fabulous location opposite Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace and so has good transport links for central London as well as amazing views. We had great fun with Manvee planning the event and we very grateful to Grant and Fabrizio for putting it all together on the day and making the room look amazing. These guys accommodated our every request with no problem or question. Every staff member we came across was friendly helpful and professional. The day was finished off perfectly when we went back to our room and found rose petals scattered everywhere! We were so glad we chose the Milestone, we always felt very welcome and looked after when we visited and the whole experience was a pleasure. We will be going back there for many years to come.

I was absolutely delighted to read your kind words following your recent celebrations at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased that we met your expectations and that our team ensured everything went to plan. I have passed on your thanks to Manveer, Grant and Fabrizio plus the rest of the team. I sincerely hope that you will come and stay with us again and once again congratulations on your wedding. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

I have stayed at many 5 star hotels all over the world and The Milestone truly tops them all. My wife and I has 2 nights there on 13th and 14th August and were treated to an upgrade on arrival. The suite was beautiful and the staff couldn't do enough to help. It sounds like a cliche to say we were treated like royalty but I can think of no other way to describe it. From the doorman on our arrival, to the delightful reception ladies on check in, to Pedro who showed us around introducing us to all of the team, to the helpful concierge who arranged a car for us for an afternoon's sight seeing, to the barman who made us a special cocktail as we couldn't decide from the menu.....I could go on. The location of the hotel is literally opposite Kensington gardens and is also convenient to walk to Harrods and the main shopping area. There is simply no other hotel in London than we would consider staying at from now on.

I was really pleased to read that you found the location, service and facilities of the hotel to your liking and we hope to be able to welcome you back again in the near future. Kind regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We had our wedding celebration at The Milestone last weekend and it could not have been more perfect. From the welcome both we and our guests received to the delicious food, service and accommodation we would not have changed anything. The hotel is in a fabulous location opposite Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace and so has good transport links for central London as well as amazing views. We had great fun with Manvee planning the event and we very grateful to Grant and Fabrizio for putting it all together on the day and making the room look amazing. These guys accommodated our every request with no problem or question. Every staff member we came across was friendly helpful and professional. The day was finished off perfectly when we went back to our room and found rose petals scattered everywhere! We were so glad we chose the Milestone, we always felt very welcome and looked after when we visited and the whole experience was a pleasure. We will be going back there for many years to come.

I was absolutely delighted to read your kind words following your recent celebrations at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased that we met your expectations and that our team ensured everything went to plan. I have passed on your thanks to Manveer, Grant and Fabrizio plus the rest of the team. I sincerely hope that you will come and stay with us again and once again congratulations on your wedding. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager

I have stayed at many 5 star hotels all over the world and The Milestone truly tops them all. My wife and I has 2 nights there on 13th and 14th August and were treated to an upgrade on arrival. The suite was beautiful and the staff couldn't do enough to help. It sounds like a cliche to say we were treated like royalty but I can think of no other way to describe it. From the doorman on our arrival, to the delightful reception ladies on check in, to Pedro who showed us around introducing us to all of the team, to the helpful concierge who arranged a car for us for an afternoon's sight seeing, to the barman who made us a special cocktail as we couldn't decide from the menu.....I could go on. The location of the hotel is literally opposite Kensington gardens and is also convenient to walk to Harrods and the main shopping area. There is simply no other hotel in London than we would consider staying at from now on.

I was absolutely delighted to read your thoughts on your recent stay at The Milestone Hotel. I was really glad to read that you enjoyed your stay and the service you received. I have passed on your kind words to Pedro and to the rest of the team. Many thanks for taking the time to write your review and we hope to be able to welcome you back in the near future.

We recently stayed at this hotel for 3 days. The hotel is very nice, our room was perfect. The whole staff is very pleasant and friendly and knew us by name. The breakfast is excellent too! I would definitely stay there again on our next trip to London.

I was so happy to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I would also like to thank you for taking the time to write your kind words. I have passed these on to my team here at the hotel and we all hope to welcome you back soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We had tea at the Milestone and it was fabulous. The ambiance and service were second to none. The tea was excellent and the sandwiches, cakes, and scones were beautiful and ever so tasty. I would love to stay at this lovely hotel the next time we are in London. It is an incredible property.

Thank you very much for taking the time to write your kind words following your Afternoon Tea experience at The Milestone Hotel. I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed it and found the food service, food and facilities met your expectations. I hope that you will come and stay with us in the near future. Kind regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

We just completed a 3 night family vacation at The Milestone. The hotel is quaint and decorated as a beautiful English home. Each hotel room is decorated differently. We had two rooms and one was more beautiful then the other. The breakfast buffet is great with many options. Continental which included cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit ,assorted breads and pastries or order off a full menu. The concierge planned our whole trip. Private tours, dinner and theatre tickets. Every choice was perfect! The staff all know your name the moment you arrive and can not do enough to help you. We had a sick teenager one morning and Andrea ( the concierge) personally made phone calls for us and accompanied my husband to a pharmacy. The personal service was the best we have experienced in any hotel. We can not wait to return.

I was really pleased to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted that you and your family liked all the facilities and service at the hotel. I was also happy to read your comments about our Concierge Andrea and how he helped you. I have passed on your kind words to him and the rest of the team. Please do come and see us again soon. My kindest regards, Andrew Pike General Manager

This is a really "nice" hotel. The staff are warm and friendly, the decor perfect. My wife arrived back from shopping in a cab to find she only had "Old Pounds" the doorman quickly paid the cab driver and took care of the problem. The atmosphere is English, calm and understated, you don't feel as if you are in chain hotel that could be anywhere. Room Tip: Try for a junior suite See more room tips

From the moment we arrived, I knew we'd "arrived." We were very early, but they changed our original room to one that would be ready much sooner and offered us tea and biscuits in the lovely front parlor. Our room was unusual with bathroom on one level and bedroom a few steps up, but lovely bedding and decor. Loved the different pillow treats each turndown. Our breakfasts were delicious served in a charming dining room with a fireplace (no need for extra warmth in July though). The bar was so British library. I'm sorry I didn't have time for a drink there. Our favorite doorman, Stephen, made us feel safe while we watched a 25K person protest on our street. Very interesting to see something like that for us small town Texas women. If I ever get back to London I hope I can stay again at the Milestone. It is FIRST CLASS!!!

We've just returned from a lovely 3 day break in London and can highly recommend it. Giles warmly welcomed us, and there were many thoughtful touches. For example, I asked at breakfast the first day for maple syrup and it arrived on day two! Room Tip: Room service was superb. Best club sandwich I've eaten for a while See more room tips

The hotel is beautiful and the staff are outstanding. Across from Hyde Park. Consider getting the two bedroom apartment instead of two separate rooms. We will definitely stay there on our next London trip.

Thank you so much for taking the time to write your kind words following your recent stay with us at The Milestone Hotel. I was delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay with us. As you mentioned our 2 bedroom apartments are a really good option and also good value. We look forward to welcoming you back soon. Best wishes, Andrew Pike General Manager
