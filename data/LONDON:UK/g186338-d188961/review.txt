Cannot explain how luxurious my 2 night break away was. Fantastic hotel, worth every penny and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Expensive rooms but would only be a problem if the room was not worth of price. Will certainly return in near future!

The best hotel I have stayed in - also one of the most expensive hotels I have stayed in but worth every penny. I wanted somewhere very special for our anniversary and looking on tripadvisor this seemed to fit the bill. I was not disappointed the staff were very attentive nothing was a bother to them. Although it seemed expensive everything was included including champagne on arrival, snacks in the day and breakfast. The only problem is if I now take my wife anywhere else she will be disappointed.

This was a special 2 night break for our wedding anniversary . This is the best hotel I've stayed in . Fab fab, nothing was any trouble, great breakfasts and service, attention to detail on everything. From booking in with champagne to afternoon tea, I can honestly say there was nothing to fault beautiful. Would return at any given chance, expensive but was a wonderful treat.

Having combed Trip Advisor for suggestions where to stay for my wife's birthday, it was soon apparent that this hotel was somewhere very special to those who stayed here. The hotel staff made us feel so welcome it was just the spot to celebrate. Nothing was too much trouble, always on hand to help but never over-zealous, giving time and space to enjoy the lovely atmosphere in the hotel. The 'Plunder the Pantry' was a revelation, another very positive plus as it allowed an opportunity to sit and relax between trips out to enjoy the city. There can be no doubt that this is one of the very best places (if not the best) to stay if you are in London.

This was our second stay here and this time we chose a junior suite (stayed in the magnificent conservatory suite on our honeymoon) and found it to be very spacious and very comfortable. Service was very smooth and everyone was eager to please (continually being offered tea/coffee/champagne). We were warmly and royally welcomed back by Monica, Lauren and Juliana. Prior to checking in, we stopped in to say hi and was offered champagne and had a nice chat with Stef. Breakfast was excellent as was plundering the pantry every evening. The romantic rose turn down one evening with all the candles was very special and romantic. I don't know what else to add from our previous review and what others have said, except we plan to stay here on our annual family visit to the UK. See you next May. Room Tip: Rooms at the back tend to be quieter given all the construction in the area. See more room tips

Greeted on our arrival by friendly staff & taken to the Executive Lounge where we were served a glass of champagne. Escorted to our room only to find out that we had been upgraded to a fabulous room. Inside a congratulations cake & sweets. We had canapÃ©s & plunder the pantry, then we went back to the room to find evening turn down, candles, rose petals & music. I was very emotional. Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41. Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere. We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave. Made a promise to each other, that when we come back to England, we stay here again. Treat yourself & stay here, you will fall in love as well. Thank you to all the staff for making our special celebration even more wonderful.

We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in May of this year and again in August. We love this hotel. The service is fabulous lead by the wonderful, Lauren. All of the staff was so friendly and helpful. All requests were filled - they got our tickets for everything we wanted to do and made all our dinner reservations. We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good! Great canapÃ©s at cocktail time in the lounge. The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city. Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41.

This is a small boutique hotel with outstanding service. It's quirky and individual and will not appeal to everyone, but I really like it. The interior is all wood, brass and mirrors, and the heart is the executive lounge which functions as reception, bar. lounge and restaurant. The relatively small number of rooms allows them to offer a very individual service. The breakfast is wonderful, with a wide range of hot options to supplement the cold buffet. In the evening substantial snacks and drinks are included in the rate. Rooms are all very individual -I have stayed in three different ones. Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one. But not a big issue for me as I am generally out during the day anyway The rooms are very well equipped, as are the bathrooms, which have incredibly powerful showers. Delicious fresh fruit was provided in the room, replenished every day - not just a couple of manky apples which gradually go soft during your stay. I think the rates are competitive when you consider the level of service, and what is included. It is different to many other places you will have stayed, but when you are next in London I do recommend you give it a try

We had an enjoyable stay at Hotel 41 while we were recently in London. We were thoroughly impressed with the impeccable service and location of the property. Monika and the rest of the team was absolutely wonderful and helpful in every way. They took care of many of our reservations and had insightful recommendations. There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing! If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place for you. This is a quiet and relaxed boutique hotel that allows you to unwind after a day in the busy city. We loved it! We will stay here again on our next visit to London. Room Tip: If you can, reserve the suite that connects to the sitting room See more room tips

My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41. From the moment we checked in, they made us feel so at home. We had lost our luggage and they were incredibly gracious & kind about helping us get some supplies. The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit.

The hotel staff made us feel so welcome it was just the spot to celebrate. Nothing was too much trouble, always on hand to help but never over-zealous, giving time and space to enjoy the lovely atmosphere in the hotel. The 'Plunder the Pantry' was a revelation, another very positive plus as it allowed an opportunity to sit and relax between trips out to enjoy the city. There can be no doubt that this is one of the very best places (if not the best) to stay if you are in London.

This was our second stay here and this time we chose a junior suite (stayed in the magnificent conservatory suite on our honeymoon) and found it to be very spacious and very comfortable. Service was very smooth and everyone was eager to please (continually being offered tea/coffee/champagne). We were warmly and royally welcomed back by Monica, Lauren and Juliana. Prior to checking in, we stopped in to say hi and was offered champagne and had a nice chat with Stef. Breakfast was excellent as was plundering the pantry every evening. The romantic rose turn down one evening with all the candles was very special and romantic. I don't know what else to add from our previous review and what others have said, except we plan to stay here on our annual family visit to the UK. See you next May. Room Tip: Rooms at the back tend to be quieter given all the construction in the area. See more room tips

Greeted on our arrival by friendly staff & taken to the Executive Lounge where we were served a glass of champagne. Escorted to our room only to find out that we had been upgraded to a fabulous room. Inside a congratulations cake & sweets. We had canapÃ©s & plunder the pantry, then we went back to the room to find evening turn down, candles, rose petals & music. I was very emotional. Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41. Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere. We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave. Made a promise to each other, that when we come back to England, we stay here again. Treat yourself & stay here, you will fall in love as well. Thank you to all the staff for making our special celebration even more wonderful.

We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in May of this year and again in August. We love this hotel. The service is fabulous lead by the wonderful, Lauren. All of the staff was so friendly and helpful. All requests were filled - they got our tickets for everything we wanted to do and made all our dinner reservations. We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good! Great canapÃ©s at cocktail time in the lounge. The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city. Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41.

This is a small boutique hotel with outstanding service. It's quirky and individual and will not appeal to everyone, but I really like it. The interior is all wood, brass and mirrors, and the heart is the executive lounge which functions as reception, bar. lounge and restaurant. The relatively small number of rooms allows them to offer a very individual service. The breakfast is wonderful, with a wide range of hot options to supplement the cold buffet. In the evening substantial snacks and drinks are included in the rate. Rooms are all very individual -I have stayed in three different ones. Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one. But not a big issue for me as I am generally out during the day anyway The rooms are very well equipped, as are the bathrooms, which have incredibly powerful showers. Delicious fresh fruit was provided in the room, replenished every day - not just a couple of manky apples which gradually go soft during your stay. I think the rates are competitive when you consider the level of service, and what is included. It is different to many other places you will have stayed, but when you are next in London I do recommend you give it a try

We had an enjoyable stay at Hotel 41 while we were recently in London. We were thoroughly impressed with the impeccable service and location of the property. Monika and the rest of the team was absolutely wonderful and helpful in every way. They took care of many of our reservations and had insightful recommendations. There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing! If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place for you. This is a quiet and relaxed boutique hotel that allows you to unwind after a day in the busy city. We loved it! We will stay here again on our next visit to London. Room Tip: If you can, reserve the suite that connects to the sitting room See more room tips

My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41. From the moment we checked in, they made us feel so at home. We had lost our luggage and they were incredibly gracious & kind about helping us get some supplies. The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit.

Cannot explain how luxurious my 2 night break away was. Fantastic hotel, worth every penny and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Expensive rooms but would only be a problem if the room was not worth of price. Will certainly return in near future!

The best hotel I have stayed in - also one of the most expensive hotels I have stayed in but worth every penny. I wanted somewhere very special for our anniversary and looking on tripadvisor this seemed to fit the bill. I was not disappointed the staff were very attentive nothing was a bother to them. Although it seemed expensive everything was included including champagne on arrival, snacks in the day and breakfast. The only problem is if I now take my wife anywhere else she will be disappointed.

Prior to checking in, we stopped in to say hi and was offered champagne and had a nice chat with Stef. Breakfast was excellent as was plundering the pantry every evening. The romantic rose turn down one evening with all the candles was very special and romantic. I don't know what else to add from our previous review and what others have said, except we plan to stay here on our annual family visit to the UK. See you next May. Room Tip: Rooms at the back tend to be quieter given all the construction in the area. See more room tips

Greeted on our arrival by friendly staff & taken to the Executive Lounge where we were served a glass of champagne. Escorted to our room only to find out that we had been upgraded to a fabulous room. Inside a congratulations cake & sweets. We had canapÃ©s & plunder the pantry, then we went back to the room to find evening turn down, candles, rose petals & music. I was very emotional. Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41. Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere. We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave. Made a promise to each other, that when we come back to England, we stay here again. Treat yourself & stay here, you will fall in love as well. Thank you to all the staff for making our special celebration even more wonderful.

We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in May of this year and again in August. We love this hotel. The service is fabulous lead by the wonderful, Lauren. All of the staff was so friendly and helpful. All requests were filled - they got our tickets for everything we wanted to do and made all our dinner reservations. We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good! Great canapÃ©s at cocktail time in the lounge. The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city. Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41.

This is a small boutique hotel with outstanding service. It's quirky and individual and will not appeal to everyone, but I really like it. The interior is all wood, brass and mirrors, and the heart is the executive lounge which functions as reception, bar. lounge and restaurant. The relatively small number of rooms allows them to offer a very individual service. The breakfast is wonderful, with a wide range of hot options to supplement the cold buffet. In the evening substantial snacks and drinks are included in the rate. Rooms are all very individual -I have stayed in three different ones. Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one. But not a big issue for me as I am generally out during the day anyway The rooms are very well equipped, as are the bathrooms, which have incredibly powerful showers. Delicious fresh fruit was provided in the room, replenished every day - not just a couple of manky apples which gradually go soft during your stay. I think the rates are competitive when you consider the level of service, and what is included. It is different to many other places you will have stayed, but when you are next in London I do recommend you give it a try

We had an enjoyable stay at Hotel 41 while we were recently in London. We were thoroughly impressed with the impeccable service and location of the property. Monika and the rest of the team was absolutely wonderful and helpful in every way. They took care of many of our reservations and had insightful recommendations. There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing! If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place for you. This is a quiet and relaxed boutique hotel that allows you to unwind after a day in the busy city. We loved it! We will stay here again on our next visit to London. Room Tip: If you can, reserve the suite that connects to the sitting room See more room tips

My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41. From the moment we checked in, they made us feel so at home. We had lost our luggage and they were incredibly gracious & kind about helping us get some supplies. The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit.

Cannot explain how luxurious my 2 night break away was. Fantastic hotel, worth every penny and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Expensive rooms but would only be a problem if the room was not worth of price. Will certainly return in near future!

The best hotel I have stayed in - also one of the most expensive hotels I have stayed in but worth every penny. I wanted somewhere very special for our anniversary and looking on tripadvisor this seemed to fit the bill. I was not disappointed the staff were very attentive nothing was a bother to them. Although it seemed expensive everything was included including champagne on arrival, snacks in the day and breakfast. The only problem is if I now take my wife anywhere else she will be disappointed.

This was a special 2 night break for our wedding anniversary . This is the best hotel I've stayed in . Fab fab, nothing was any trouble, great breakfasts and service, attention to detail on everything. From booking in with champagne to afternoon tea, I can honestly say there was nothing to fault beautiful. Would return at any given chance, expensive but was a wonderful treat.

Having combed Trip Advisor for suggestions where to stay for my wife's birthday, it was soon apparent that this hotel was somewhere very special to those who stayed here. The hotel staff made us feel so welcome it was just the spot to celebrate. Nothing was too much trouble, always on hand to help but never over-zealous, giving time and space to enjoy the lovely atmosphere in the hotel. The 'Plunder the Pantry' was a revelation, another very positive plus as it allowed an opportunity to sit and relax between trips out to enjoy the city. There can be no doubt that this is one of the very best places (if not the best) to stay if you are in London.

Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41. Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere. We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave. Made a promise to each other, that when we come back to England, we stay here again. Treat yourself & stay here, you will fall in love as well. Thank you to all the staff for making our special celebration even more wonderful.

We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in May of this year and again in August. We love this hotel. The service is fabulous lead by the wonderful, Lauren. All of the staff was so friendly and helpful. All requests were filled - they got our tickets for everything we wanted to do and made all our dinner reservations. We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good! Great canapÃ©s at cocktail time in the lounge. The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city. Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41.

This is a small boutique hotel with outstanding service. It's quirky and individual and will not appeal to everyone, but I really like it. The interior is all wood, brass and mirrors, and the heart is the executive lounge which functions as reception, bar. lounge and restaurant. The relatively small number of rooms allows them to offer a very individual service. The breakfast is wonderful, with a wide range of hot options to supplement the cold buffet. In the evening substantial snacks and drinks are included in the rate. Rooms are all very individual -I have stayed in three different ones. Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one. But not a big issue for me as I am generally out during the day anyway The rooms are very well equipped, as are the bathrooms, which have incredibly powerful showers. Delicious fresh fruit was provided in the room, replenished every day - not just a couple of manky apples which gradually go soft during your stay. I think the rates are competitive when you consider the level of service, and what is included. It is different to many other places you will have stayed, but when you are next in London I do recommend you give it a try

We had an enjoyable stay at Hotel 41 while we were recently in London. We were thoroughly impressed with the impeccable service and location of the property. Monika and the rest of the team was absolutely wonderful and helpful in every way. They took care of many of our reservations and had insightful recommendations. There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing! If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place for you. This is a quiet and relaxed boutique hotel that allows you to unwind after a day in the busy city. We loved it! We will stay here again on our next visit to London.

My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41. From the moment we checked in, they made us feel so at home. We had lost our luggage and they were incredibly gracious & kind about helping us get some supplies. The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit.

Cannot explain how luxurious my 2 night break away was. Fantastic hotel, worth every penny and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Expensive rooms but would only be a problem if the room was not worth of price. Will certainly return in near future!

The best hotel I have stayed in - also one of the most expensive hotels I have stayed in but worth every penny. I wanted somewhere very special for our anniversary and looking on tripadvisor this seemed to fit the bill. I was not disappointed the staff were very attentive nothing was a bother to them. Although it seemed expensive everything was included including champagne on arrival, snacks in the day and breakfast. The only problem is if I now take my wife anywhere else she will be disappointed.

This was a special 2 night break for our wedding anniversary . This is the best hotel I've stayed in . Fab fab, nothing was any trouble, great breakfasts and service, attention to detail on everything. From booking in with champagne to afternoon tea, I can honestly say there was nothing to fault beautiful. Would return at any given chance, expensive but was a wonderful treat.

Having combed Trip Advisor for suggestions where to stay for my wife's birthday, it was soon apparent that this hotel was somewhere very special to those who stayed here. The hotel staff made us feel so welcome it was just the spot to celebrate. Nothing was too much trouble, always on hand to help but never over-zealous, giving time and space to enjoy the lovely atmosphere in the hotel. The 'Plunder the Pantry' was a revelation, another very positive plus as it allowed an opportunity to sit and relax between trips out to enjoy the city. There can be no doubt that this is one of the very best places (if not the best) to stay if you are in London.

This was our second stay here and this time we chose a junior suite (stayed in the magnificent conservatory suite on our honeymoon) and found it to be very spacious and very comfortable. Service was very smooth and everyone was eager to please (continually being offered tea/coffee/champagne). We were warmly and royally welcomed back by Monica, Lauren and Juliana. Prior to checking in, we stopped in to say hi and was offered champagne and had a nice chat with Stef. Breakfast was excellent as was plundering the pantry every evening. The romantic rose turn down one evening with all the candles was very special and romantic. I don't know what else to add from our previous review and what others have said, except we plan to stay here on our annual family visit to the UK. See you next May.

We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good! Great canapÃ©s at cocktail time in the lounge. The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city. Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41.

This is a small boutique hotel with outstanding service. It's quirky and individual and will not appeal to everyone, but I really like it. The interior is all wood, brass and mirrors, and the heart is the executive lounge which functions as reception, bar. lounge and restaurant. The relatively small number of rooms allows them to offer a very individual service. The breakfast is wonderful, with a wide range of hot options to supplement the cold buffet. In the evening substantial snacks and drinks are included in the rate. Rooms are all very individual -I have stayed in three different ones. Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one. But not a big issue for me as I am generally out during the day anyway The rooms are very well equipped, as are the bathrooms, which have incredibly powerful showers. Delicious fresh fruit was provided in the room, replenished every day - not just a couple of manky apples which gradually go soft during your stay. I think the rates are competitive when you consider the level of service, and what is included. It is different to many other places you will have stayed, but when you are next in London I do recommend you give it a try

We had an enjoyable stay at Hotel 41 while we were recently in London. We were thoroughly impressed with the impeccable service and location of the property. Monika and the rest of the team was absolutely wonderful and helpful in every way. They took care of many of our reservations and had insightful recommendations. There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing! If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place for you. This is a quiet and relaxed boutique hotel that allows you to unwind after a day in the busy city. We loved it! We will stay here again on our next visit to London.

My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41. From the moment we checked in, they made us feel so at home. We had lost our luggage and they were incredibly gracious & kind about helping us get some supplies. The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit.

Cannot explain how luxurious my 2 night break away was. Fantastic hotel, worth every penny and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Expensive rooms but would only be a problem if the room was not worth of price. Will certainly return in near future!

The best hotel I have stayed in - also one of the most expensive hotels I have stayed in but worth every penny. I wanted somewhere very special for our anniversary and looking on tripadvisor this seemed to fit the bill. I was not disappointed the staff were very attentive nothing was a bother to them. Although it seemed expensive everything was included including champagne on arrival, snacks in the day and breakfast. The only problem is if I now take my wife anywhere else she will be disappointed.

This was a special 2 night break for our wedding anniversary . This is the best hotel I've stayed in . Fab fab, nothing was any trouble, great breakfasts and service, attention to detail on everything. From booking in with champagne to afternoon tea, I can honestly say there was nothing to fault beautiful. Would return at any given chance, expensive but was a wonderful treat.

Having combed Trip Advisor for suggestions where to stay for my wife's birthday, it was soon apparent that this hotel was somewhere very special to those who stayed here. The hotel staff made us feel so welcome it was just the spot to celebrate. Nothing was too much trouble, always on hand to help but never over-zealous, giving time and space to enjoy the lovely atmosphere in the hotel. The 'Plunder the Pantry' was a revelation, another very positive plus as it allowed an opportunity to sit and relax between trips out to enjoy the city. There can be no doubt that this is one of the very best places (if not the best) to stay if you are in London.

This was our second stay here and this time we chose a junior suite (stayed in the magnificent conservatory suite on our honeymoon) and found it to be very spacious and very comfortable. Service was very smooth and everyone was eager to please (continually being offered tea/coffee/champagne). We were warmly and royally welcomed back by Monica, Lauren and Juliana. Prior to checking in, we stopped in to say hi and was offered champagne and had a nice chat with Stef. Breakfast was excellent as was plundering the pantry every evening. The romantic rose turn down one evening with all the candles was very special and romantic. I don't know what else to add from our previous review and what others have said, except we plan to stay here on our annual family visit to the UK. See you next May. Room Tip: Rooms at the back tend to be quieter given all the construction in the area. See more room tips

Greeted on our arrival by friendly staff & taken to the Executive Lounge where we were served a glass of champagne. Escorted to our room only to find out that we had been upgraded to a fabulous room. Inside a congratulations cake & sweets. We had canapÃ©s & plunder the pantry, then we went back to the room to find evening turn down, candles, rose petals & music. I was very emotional. Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41. Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere. We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave. Made a promise to each other, that when we come back to England, we stay here again. Treat yourself & stay here, you will fall in love as well. Thank you to all the staff for making our special celebration even more wonderful.

Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one. But not a big issue for me as I am generally out during the day anyway The rooms are very well equipped, as are the bathrooms, which have incredibly powerful showers. Delicious fresh fruit was provided in the room, replenished every day - not just a couple of manky apples which gradually go soft during your stay. I think the rates are competitive when you consider the level of service, and what is included. It is different to many other places you will have stayed, but when you are next in London I do recommend you give it a try

We had an enjoyable stay at Hotel 41 while we were recently in London. We were thoroughly impressed with the impeccable service and location of the property. Monika and the rest of the team was absolutely wonderful and helpful in every way. They took care of many of our reservations and had insightful recommendations. There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing! If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place for you. This is a quiet and relaxed boutique hotel that allows you to unwind after a day in the busy city. We loved it! We will stay here again on our next visit to London. Room Tip: If you can, reserve the suite that connects to the sitting room See more room tips

My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41. From the moment we checked in, they made us feel so at home. We had lost our luggage and they were incredibly gracious & kind about helping us get some supplies. The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit.

Cannot explain how luxurious my 2 night break away was. Fantastic hotel, worth every penny and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Expensive rooms but would only be a problem if the room was not worth of price. Will certainly return in near future!

The best hotel I have stayed in - also one of the most expensive hotels I have stayed in but worth every penny. I wanted somewhere very special for our anniversary and looking on tripadvisor this seemed to fit the bill. I was not disappointed the staff were very attentive nothing was a bother to them. Although it seemed expensive everything was included including champagne on arrival, snacks in the day and breakfast. The only problem is if I now take my wife anywhere else she will be disappointed.

This was a special 2 night break for our wedding anniversary . This is the best hotel I've stayed in . Fab fab, nothing was any trouble, great breakfasts and service, attention to detail on everything. From booking in with champagne to afternoon tea, I can honestly say there was nothing to fault beautiful. Would return at any given chance, expensive but was a wonderful treat.

Having combed Trip Advisor for suggestions where to stay for my wife's birthday, it was soon apparent that this hotel was somewhere very special to those who stayed here. The hotel staff made us feel so welcome it was just the spot to celebrate. Nothing was too much trouble, always on hand to help but never over-zealous, giving time and space to enjoy the lovely atmosphere in the hotel. The 'Plunder the Pantry' was a revelation, another very positive plus as it allowed an opportunity to sit and relax between trips out to enjoy the city. There can be no doubt that this is one of the very best places (if not the best) to stay if you are in London.

This was our second stay here and this time we chose a junior suite (stayed in the magnificent conservatory suite on our honeymoon) and found it to be very spacious and very comfortable. Service was very smooth and everyone was eager to please (continually being offered tea/coffee/champagne). We were warmly and royally welcomed back by Monica, Lauren and Juliana. Prior to checking in, we stopped in to say hi and was offered champagne and had a nice chat with Stef. Breakfast was excellent as was plundering the pantry every evening. The romantic rose turn down one evening with all the candles was very special and romantic. I don't know what else to add from our previous review and what others have said, except we plan to stay here on our annual family visit to the UK. See you next May. Room Tip: Rooms at the back tend to be quieter given all the construction in the area. See more room tips

Greeted on our arrival by friendly staff & taken to the Executive Lounge where we were served a glass of champagne. Escorted to our room only to find out that we had been upgraded to a fabulous room. Inside a congratulations cake & sweets. We had canapÃ©s & plunder the pantry, then we went back to the room to find evening turn down, candles, rose petals & music. I was very emotional. Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41. Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere. We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave. Made a promise to each other, that when we come back to England, we stay here again. Treat yourself & stay here, you will fall in love as well. Thank you to all the staff for making our special celebration even more wonderful.

We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in May of this year and again in August. We love this hotel. The service is fabulous lead by the wonderful, Lauren. All of the staff was so friendly and helpful. All requests were filled - they got our tickets for everything we wanted to do and made all our dinner reservations. We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good! Great canapÃ©s at cocktail time in the lounge. The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city. Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41.

This is a small boutique hotel with outstanding service. It's quirky and individual and will not appeal to everyone, but I really like it. The interior is all wood, brass and mirrors, and the heart is the executive lounge which functions as reception, bar. lounge and restaurant.

There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing! If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place for you. This is a quiet and relaxed boutique hotel that allows you to unwind after a day in the busy city. We loved it! We will stay here again on our next visit to London.

My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41. From the moment we checked in, they made us feel so at home. We had lost our luggage and they were incredibly gracious & kind about helping us get some supplies. The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit.

Cannot explain how luxurious my 2 night break away was. Fantastic hotel, worth every penny and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Expensive rooms but would only be a problem if the room was not worth of price. Will certainly return in near future!

The best hotel I have stayed in - also one of the most expensive hotels I have stayed in but worth every penny. I wanted somewhere very special for our anniversary and looking on tripadvisor this seemed to fit the bill. I was not disappointed the staff were very attentive nothing was a bother to them. Although it seemed expensive everything was included including champagne on arrival, snacks in the day and breakfast. The only problem is if I now take my wife anywhere else she will be disappointed.

This was a special 2 night break for our wedding anniversary . This is the best hotel I've stayed in . Fab fab, nothing was any trouble, great breakfasts and service, attention to detail on everything. From booking in with champagne to afternoon tea, I can honestly say there was nothing to fault beautiful. Would return at any given chance, expensive but was a wonderful treat.

Having combed Trip Advisor for suggestions where to stay for my wife's birthday, it was soon apparent that this hotel was somewhere very special to those who stayed here. The hotel staff made us feel so welcome it was just the spot to celebrate. Nothing was too much trouble, always on hand to help but never over-zealous, giving time and space to enjoy the lovely atmosphere in the hotel. The 'Plunder the Pantry' was a revelation, another very positive plus as it allowed an opportunity to sit and relax between trips out to enjoy the city. There can be no doubt that this is one of the very best places (if not the best) to stay if you are in London.

This was our second stay here and this time we chose a junior suite (stayed in the magnificent conservatory suite on our honeymoon) and found it to be very spacious and very comfortable. Service was very smooth and everyone was eager to please (continually being offered tea/coffee/champagne). We were warmly and royally welcomed back by Monica, Lauren and Juliana. Prior to checking in, we stopped in to say hi and was offered champagne and had a nice chat with Stef. Breakfast was excellent as was plundering the pantry every evening. The romantic rose turn down one evening with all the candles was very special and romantic. I don't know what else to add from our previous review and what others have said, except we plan to stay here on our annual family visit to the UK. See you next May. Room Tip: Rooms at the back tend to be quieter given all the construction in the area. See more room tips

Greeted on our arrival by friendly staff & taken to the Executive Lounge where we were served a glass of champagne. Escorted to our room only to find out that we had been upgraded to a fabulous room. Inside a congratulations cake & sweets. We had canapÃ©s & plunder the pantry, then we went back to the room to find evening turn down, candles, rose petals & music. I was very emotional. Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41. Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere. We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave. Made a promise to each other, that when we come back to England, we stay here again. Treat yourself & stay here, you will fall in love as well. Thank you to all the staff for making our special celebration even more wonderful.

We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in May of this year and again in August. We love this hotel. The service is fabulous lead by the wonderful, Lauren. All of the staff was so friendly and helpful. All requests were filled - they got our tickets for everything we wanted to do and made all our dinner reservations. We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good! Great canapÃ©s at cocktail time in the lounge. The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city. Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41.

This is a small boutique hotel with outstanding service. It's quirky and individual and will not appeal to everyone, but I really like it. The interior is all wood, brass and mirrors, and the heart is the executive lounge which functions as reception, bar. lounge and restaurant. The relatively small number of rooms allows them to offer a very individual service. The breakfast is wonderful, with a wide range of hot options to supplement the cold buffet. In the evening substantial snacks and drinks are included in the rate. Rooms are all very individual -I have stayed in three different ones. Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one. But not a big issue for me as I am generally out during the day anyway The rooms are very well equipped, as are the bathrooms, which have incredibly powerful showers. Delicious fresh fruit was provided in the room, replenished every day - not just a couple of manky apples which gradually go soft during your stay. I think the rates are competitive when you consider the level of service, and what is included. It is different to many other places you will have stayed, but when you are next in London I do recommend you give it a try

The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit.

Cannot explain how luxurious my 2 night break away was. Fantastic hotel, worth every penny and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Expensive rooms but would only be a problem if the room was not worth of price. Will certainly return in near future!

The best hotel I have stayed in - also one of the most expensive hotels I have stayed in but worth every penny. I wanted somewhere very special for our anniversary and looking on tripadvisor this seemed to fit the bill. I was not disappointed the staff were very attentive nothing was a bother to them. Although it seemed expensive everything was included including champagne on arrival, snacks in the day and breakfast. The only problem is if I now take my wife anywhere else she will be disappointed.

This was a special 2 night break for our wedding anniversary . This is the best hotel I've stayed in . Fab fab, nothing was any trouble, great breakfasts and service, attention to detail on everything. From booking in with champagne to afternoon tea, I can honestly say there was nothing to fault beautiful. Would return at any given chance, expensive but was a wonderful treat.

Having combed Trip Advisor for suggestions where to stay for my wife's birthday, it was soon apparent that this hotel was somewhere very special to those who stayed here. The hotel staff made us feel so welcome it was just the spot to celebrate. Nothing was too much trouble, always on hand to help but never over-zealous, giving time and space to enjoy the lovely atmosphere in the hotel. The 'Plunder the Pantry' was a revelation, another very positive plus as it allowed an opportunity to sit and relax between trips out to enjoy the city. There can be no doubt that this is one of the very best places (if not the best) to stay if you are in London.

This was our second stay here and this time we chose a junior suite (stayed in the magnificent conservatory suite on our honeymoon) and found it to be very spacious and very comfortable. Service was very smooth and everyone was eager to please (continually being offered tea/coffee/champagne). We were warmly and royally welcomed back by Monica, Lauren and Juliana. Prior to checking in, we stopped in to say hi and was offered champagne and had a nice chat with Stef. Breakfast was excellent as was plundering the pantry every evening. The romantic rose turn down one evening with all the candles was very special and romantic. I don't know what else to add from our previous review and what others have said, except we plan to stay here on our annual family visit to the UK. See you next May. Room Tip: Rooms at the back tend to be quieter given all the construction in the area. See more room tips

Greeted on our arrival by friendly staff & taken to the Executive Lounge where we were served a glass of champagne. Escorted to our room only to find out that we had been upgraded to a fabulous room. Inside a congratulations cake & sweets. We had canapÃ©s & plunder the pantry, then we went back to the room to find evening turn down, candles, rose petals & music. I was very emotional. Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41. Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere. We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave. Made a promise to each other, that when we come back to England, we stay here again. Treat yourself & stay here, you will fall in love as well. Thank you to all the staff for making our special celebration even more wonderful.

We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in May of this year and again in August. We love this hotel. The service is fabulous lead by the wonderful, Lauren. All of the staff was so friendly and helpful. All requests were filled - they got our tickets for everything we wanted to do and made all our dinner reservations. We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good! Great canapÃ©s at cocktail time in the lounge. The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city. Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41.

This is a small boutique hotel with outstanding service. It's quirky and individual and will not appeal to everyone, but I really like it. The interior is all wood, brass and mirrors, and the heart is the executive lounge which functions as reception, bar. lounge and restaurant. The relatively small number of rooms allows them to offer a very individual service. The breakfast is wonderful, with a wide range of hot options to supplement the cold buffet. In the evening substantial snacks and drinks are included in the rate. Rooms are all very individual -I have stayed in three different ones. Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one. But not a big issue for me as I am generally out during the day anyway The rooms are very well equipped, as are the bathrooms, which have incredibly powerful showers. Delicious fresh fruit was provided in the room, replenished every day - not just a couple of manky apples which gradually go soft during your stay. I think the rates are competitive when you consider the level of service, and what is included. It is different to many other places you will have stayed, but when you are next in London I do recommend you give it a try

We had an enjoyable stay at Hotel 41 while we were recently in London. We were thoroughly impressed with the impeccable service and location of the property. Monika and the rest of the team was absolutely wonderful and helpful in every way. They took care of many of our reservations and had insightful recommendations. There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing! If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place for you. This is a quiet and relaxed boutique hotel that allows you to unwind after a day in the busy city. We loved it! We will stay here again on our next visit to London.

Although it seemed expensive everything was included including champagne on arrival, snacks in the day and breakfast. The only problem is if I now take my wife anywhere else she will be disappointed.

This was a special 2 night break for our wedding anniversary . This is the best hotel I've stayed in . Fab fab, nothing was any trouble, great breakfasts and service, attention to detail on everything. From booking in with champagne to afternoon tea, I can honestly say there was nothing to fault beautiful. Would return at any given chance, expensive but was a wonderful treat.

Having combed Trip Advisor for suggestions where to stay for my wife's birthday, it was soon apparent that this hotel was somewhere very special to those who stayed here. The hotel staff made us feel so welcome it was just the spot to celebrate. Nothing was too much trouble, always on hand to help but never over-zealous, giving time and space to enjoy the lovely atmosphere in the hotel. The 'Plunder the Pantry' was a revelation, another very positive plus as it allowed an opportunity to sit and relax between trips out to enjoy the city. There can be no doubt that this is one of the very best places (if not the best) to stay if you are in London.

This was our second stay here and this time we chose a junior suite (stayed in the magnificent conservatory suite on our honeymoon) and found it to be very spacious and very comfortable. Service was very smooth and everyone was eager to please (continually being offered tea/coffee/champagne). We were warmly and royally welcomed back by Monica, Lauren and Juliana. Prior to checking in, we stopped in to say hi and was offered champagne and had a nice chat with Stef. Breakfast was excellent as was plundering the pantry every evening. The romantic rose turn down one evening with all the candles was very special and romantic. I don't know what else to add from our previous review and what others have said, except we plan to stay here on our annual family visit to the UK. See you next May. Room Tip: Rooms at the back tend to be quieter given all the construction in the area. See more room tips

Greeted on our arrival by friendly staff & taken to the Executive Lounge where we were served a glass of champagne. Escorted to our room only to find out that we had been upgraded to a fabulous room. Inside a congratulations cake & sweets. We had canapÃ©s & plunder the pantry, then we went back to the room to find evening turn down, candles, rose petals & music. I was very emotional. Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41. Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere. We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave. Made a promise to each other, that when we come back to England, we stay here again. Treat yourself & stay here, you will fall in love as well. Thank you to all the staff for making our special celebration even more wonderful.

We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in May of this year and again in August. We love this hotel. The service is fabulous lead by the wonderful, Lauren. All of the staff was so friendly and helpful. All requests were filled - they got our tickets for everything we wanted to do and made all our dinner reservations. We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good! Great canapÃ©s at cocktail time in the lounge. The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city. Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41.

This is a small boutique hotel with outstanding service. It's quirky and individual and will not appeal to everyone, but I really like it. The interior is all wood, brass and mirrors, and the heart is the executive lounge which functions as reception, bar. lounge and restaurant. The relatively small number of rooms allows them to offer a very individual service. The breakfast is wonderful, with a wide range of hot options to supplement the cold buffet. In the evening substantial snacks and drinks are included in the rate. Rooms are all very individual -I have stayed in three different ones. Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one. But not a big issue for me as I am generally out during the day anyway The rooms are very well equipped, as are the bathrooms, which have incredibly powerful showers. Delicious fresh fruit was provided in the room, replenished every day - not just a couple of manky apples which gradually go soft during your stay. I think the rates are competitive when you consider the level of service, and what is included. It is different to many other places you will have stayed, but when you are next in London I do recommend you give it a try

We had an enjoyable stay at Hotel 41 while we were recently in London. We were thoroughly impressed with the impeccable service and location of the property. Monika and the rest of the team was absolutely wonderful and helpful in every way. They took care of many of our reservations and had insightful recommendations. There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing! If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place for you. This is a quiet and relaxed boutique hotel that allows you to unwind after a day in the busy city. We loved it! We will stay here again on our next visit to London. Room Tip: If you can, reserve the suite that connects to the sitting room See more room tips

My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41. From the moment we checked in, they made us feel so at home. We had lost our luggage and they were incredibly gracious & kind about helping us get some supplies. The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit.

Cannot explain how luxurious my 2 night break away was. Fantastic hotel, worth every penny and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Expensive rooms but would only be a problem if the room was not worth of price. Will certainly return in near future!

The 'Plunder the Pantry' was a revelation, another very positive plus as it allowed an opportunity to sit and relax between trips out to enjoy the city. There can be no doubt that this is one of the very best places (if not the best) to stay if you are in London.

This was our second stay here and this time we chose a junior suite (stayed in the magnificent conservatory suite on our honeymoon) and found it to be very spacious and very comfortable. Service was very smooth and everyone was eager to please (continually being offered tea/coffee/champagne). We were warmly and royally welcomed back by Monica, Lauren and Juliana. Prior to checking in, we stopped in to say hi and was offered champagne and had a nice chat with Stef. Breakfast was excellent as was plundering the pantry every evening. The romantic rose turn down one evening with all the candles was very special and romantic. I don't know what else to add from our previous review and what others have said, except we plan to stay here on our annual family visit to the UK. See you next May. Room Tip: Rooms at the back tend to be quieter given all the construction in the area. See more room tips

Greeted on our arrival by friendly staff & taken to the Executive Lounge where we were served a glass of champagne. Escorted to our room only to find out that we had been upgraded to a fabulous room. Inside a congratulations cake & sweets. We had canapÃ©s & plunder the pantry, then we went back to the room to find evening turn down, candles, rose petals & music. I was very emotional. Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41. Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere. We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave. Made a promise to each other, that when we come back to England, we stay here again. Treat yourself & stay here, you will fall in love as well. Thank you to all the staff for making our special celebration even more wonderful.

We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in May of this year and again in August. We love this hotel. The service is fabulous lead by the wonderful, Lauren. All of the staff was so friendly and helpful. All requests were filled - they got our tickets for everything we wanted to do and made all our dinner reservations. We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good! Great canapÃ©s at cocktail time in the lounge. The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city. Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41.

This is a small boutique hotel with outstanding service. It's quirky and individual and will not appeal to everyone, but I really like it. The interior is all wood, brass and mirrors, and the heart is the executive lounge which functions as reception, bar. lounge and restaurant. The relatively small number of rooms allows them to offer a very individual service. The breakfast is wonderful, with a wide range of hot options to supplement the cold buffet. In the evening substantial snacks and drinks are included in the rate. Rooms are all very individual -I have stayed in three different ones. Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one. But not a big issue for me as I am generally out during the day anyway The rooms are very well equipped, as are the bathrooms, which have incredibly powerful showers. Delicious fresh fruit was provided in the room, replenished every day - not just a couple of manky apples which gradually go soft during your stay. I think the rates are competitive when you consider the level of service, and what is included. It is different to many other places you will have stayed, but when you are next in London I do recommend you give it a try

We had an enjoyable stay at Hotel 41 while we were recently in London. We were thoroughly impressed with the impeccable service and location of the property. Monika and the rest of the team was absolutely wonderful and helpful in every way. They took care of many of our reservations and had insightful recommendations. There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing! If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place for you. This is a quiet and relaxed boutique hotel that allows you to unwind after a day in the busy city. We loved it! We will stay here again on our next visit to London. Room Tip: If you can, reserve the suite that connects to the sitting room See more room tips

My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41. From the moment we checked in, they made us feel so at home. We had lost our luggage and they were incredibly gracious & kind about helping us get some supplies. The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit.

Cannot explain how luxurious my 2 night break away was. Fantastic hotel, worth every penny and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Expensive rooms but would only be a problem if the room was not worth of price. Will certainly return in near future!

The best hotel I have stayed in - also one of the most expensive hotels I have stayed in but worth every penny. I wanted somewhere very special for our anniversary and looking on tripadvisor this seemed to fit the bill. I was not disappointed the staff were very attentive nothing was a bother to them. Although it seemed expensive everything was included including champagne on arrival, snacks in the day and breakfast. The only problem is if I now take my wife anywhere else she will be disappointed.

This was a special 2 night break for our wedding anniversary . This is the best hotel I've stayed in . Fab fab, nothing was any trouble, great breakfasts and service, attention to detail on everything. From booking in with champagne to afternoon tea, I can honestly say there was nothing to fault beautiful. Would return at any given chance, expensive but was a wonderful treat.

Having combed Trip Advisor for suggestions where to stay for my wife's birthday, it was soon apparent that this hotel was somewhere very special to those who stayed here.

Room Tip: Rooms at the back tend to be quieter given all the construction in the area. See more room tips

Greeted on our arrival by friendly staff & taken to the Executive Lounge where we were served a glass of champagne. Escorted to our room only to find out that we had been upgraded to a fabulous room. Inside a congratulations cake & sweets. We had canapÃ©s & plunder the pantry, then we went back to the room to find evening turn down, candles, rose petals & music. I was very emotional. Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41. Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere. We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave. Made a promise to each other, that when we come back to England, we stay here again. Treat yourself & stay here, you will fall in love as well. Thank you to all the staff for making our special celebration even more wonderful.

We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in May of this year and again in August. We love this hotel. The service is fabulous lead by the wonderful, Lauren. All of the staff was so friendly and helpful. All requests were filled - they got our tickets for everything we wanted to do and made all our dinner reservations. We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good! Great canapÃ©s at cocktail time in the lounge. The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city. Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41.

This is a small boutique hotel with outstanding service. It's quirky and individual and will not appeal to everyone, but I really like it. The interior is all wood, brass and mirrors, and the heart is the executive lounge which functions as reception, bar. lounge and restaurant. The relatively small number of rooms allows them to offer a very individual service. The breakfast is wonderful, with a wide range of hot options to supplement the cold buffet. In the evening substantial snacks and drinks are included in the rate. Rooms are all very individual -I have stayed in three different ones. Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one. But not a big issue for me as I am generally out during the day anyway The rooms are very well equipped, as are the bathrooms, which have incredibly powerful showers. Delicious fresh fruit was provided in the room, replenished every day - not just a couple of manky apples which gradually go soft during your stay. I think the rates are competitive when you consider the level of service, and what is included. It is different to many other places you will have stayed, but when you are next in London I do recommend you give it a try

We had an enjoyable stay at Hotel 41 while we were recently in London. We were thoroughly impressed with the impeccable service and location of the property. Monika and the rest of the team was absolutely wonderful and helpful in every way. They took care of many of our reservations and had insightful recommendations. There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing! If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place for you. This is a quiet and relaxed boutique hotel that allows you to unwind after a day in the busy city. We loved it! We will stay here again on our next visit to London. Room Tip: If you can, reserve the suite that connects to the sitting room See more room tips

My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41. From the moment we checked in, they made us feel so at home. We had lost our luggage and they were incredibly gracious & kind about helping us get some supplies. The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit.

Cannot explain how luxurious my 2 night break away was. Fantastic hotel, worth every penny and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Expensive rooms but would only be a problem if the room was not worth of price. Will certainly return in near future!

The best hotel I have stayed in - also one of the most expensive hotels I have stayed in but worth every penny. I wanted somewhere very special for our anniversary and looking on tripadvisor this seemed to fit the bill. I was not disappointed the staff were very attentive nothing was a bother to them. Although it seemed expensive everything was included including champagne on arrival, snacks in the day and breakfast. The only problem is if I now take my wife anywhere else she will be disappointed.

This was a special 2 night break for our wedding anniversary . This is the best hotel I've stayed in . Fab fab, nothing was any trouble, great breakfasts and service, attention to detail on everything. From booking in with champagne to afternoon tea, I can honestly say there was nothing to fault beautiful. Would return at any given chance, expensive but was a wonderful treat.

Having combed Trip Advisor for suggestions where to stay for my wife's birthday, it was soon apparent that this hotel was somewhere very special to those who stayed here. The hotel staff made us feel so welcome it was just the spot to celebrate. Nothing was too much trouble, always on hand to help but never over-zealous, giving time and space to enjoy the lovely atmosphere in the hotel. The 'Plunder the Pantry' was a revelation, another very positive plus as it allowed an opportunity to sit and relax between trips out to enjoy the city. There can be no doubt that this is one of the very best places (if not the best) to stay if you are in London.

This was our second stay here and this time we chose a junior suite (stayed in the magnificent conservatory suite on our honeymoon) and found it to be very spacious and very comfortable. Service was very smooth and everyone was eager to please (continually being offered tea/coffee/champagne). We were warmly and royally welcomed back by Monica, Lauren and Juliana. Prior to checking in, we stopped in to say hi and was offered champagne and had a nice chat with Stef. Breakfast was excellent as was plundering the pantry every evening. The romantic rose turn down one evening with all the candles was very special and romantic.

We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in May of this year and again in August. We love this hotel. The service is fabulous lead by the wonderful, Lauren. All of the staff was so friendly and helpful. All requests were filled - they got our tickets for everything we wanted to do and made all our dinner reservations. We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good! Great canapÃ©s at cocktail time in the lounge. The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city. Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41.

This is a small boutique hotel with outstanding service. It's quirky and individual and will not appeal to everyone, but I really like it. The interior is all wood, brass and mirrors, and the heart is the executive lounge which functions as reception, bar. lounge and restaurant. The relatively small number of rooms allows them to offer a very individual service. The breakfast is wonderful, with a wide range of hot options to supplement the cold buffet. In the evening substantial snacks and drinks are included in the rate. Rooms are all very individual -I have stayed in three different ones. Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one. But not a big issue for me as I am generally out during the day anyway The rooms are very well equipped, as are the bathrooms, which have incredibly powerful showers. Delicious fresh fruit was provided in the room, replenished every day - not just a couple of manky apples which gradually go soft during your stay. I think the rates are competitive when you consider the level of service, and what is included. It is different to many other places you will have stayed, but when you are next in London I do recommend you give it a try

We had an enjoyable stay at Hotel 41 while we were recently in London. We were thoroughly impressed with the impeccable service and location of the property. Monika and the rest of the team was absolutely wonderful and helpful in every way. They took care of many of our reservations and had insightful recommendations. There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing! If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place for you. This is a quiet and relaxed boutique hotel that allows you to unwind after a day in the busy city. We loved it! We will stay here again on our next visit to London. Room Tip: If you can, reserve the suite that connects to the sitting room See more room tips

My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41. From the moment we checked in, they made us feel so at home. We had lost our luggage and they were incredibly gracious & kind about helping us get some supplies. The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit.

Cannot explain how luxurious my 2 night break away was. Fantastic hotel, worth every penny and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Expensive rooms but would only be a problem if the room was not worth of price. Will certainly return in near future!

The best hotel I have stayed in - also one of the most expensive hotels I have stayed in but worth every penny. I wanted somewhere very special for our anniversary and looking on tripadvisor this seemed to fit the bill. I was not disappointed the staff were very attentive nothing was a bother to them. Although it seemed expensive everything was included including champagne on arrival, snacks in the day and breakfast. The only problem is if I now take my wife anywhere else she will be disappointed.

This was a special 2 night break for our wedding anniversary . This is the best hotel I've stayed in . Fab fab, nothing was any trouble, great breakfasts and service, attention to detail on everything. From booking in with champagne to afternoon tea, I can honestly say there was nothing to fault beautiful. Would return at any given chance, expensive but was a wonderful treat.

Having combed Trip Advisor for suggestions where to stay for my wife's birthday, it was soon apparent that this hotel was somewhere very special to those who stayed here. The hotel staff made us feel so welcome it was just the spot to celebrate. Nothing was too much trouble, always on hand to help but never over-zealous, giving time and space to enjoy the lovely atmosphere in the hotel. The 'Plunder the Pantry' was a revelation, another very positive plus as it allowed an opportunity to sit and relax between trips out to enjoy the city. There can be no doubt that this is one of the very best places (if not the best) to stay if you are in London.

This was our second stay here and this time we chose a junior suite (stayed in the magnificent conservatory suite on our honeymoon) and found it to be very spacious and very comfortable. Service was very smooth and everyone was eager to please (continually being offered tea/coffee/champagne). We were warmly and royally welcomed back by Monica, Lauren and Juliana. Prior to checking in, we stopped in to say hi and was offered champagne and had a nice chat with Stef. Breakfast was excellent as was plundering the pantry every evening. The romantic rose turn down one evening with all the candles was very special and romantic. I don't know what else to add from our previous review and what others have said, except we plan to stay here on our annual family visit to the UK. See you next May. Room Tip: Rooms at the back tend to be quieter given all the construction in the area. See more room tips

Greeted on our arrival by friendly staff & taken to the Executive Lounge where we were served a glass of champagne. Escorted to our room only to find out that we had been upgraded to a fabulous room. Inside a congratulations cake & sweets. We had canapÃ©s & plunder the pantry, then we went back to the room to find evening turn down, candles, rose petals & music. I was very emotional. Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41. Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere. We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave.

In the evening substantial snacks and drinks are included in the rate. Rooms are all very individual -I have stayed in three different ones. Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one. But not a big issue for me as I am generally out during the day anyway The rooms are very well equipped, as are the bathrooms, which have incredibly powerful showers. Delicious fresh fruit was provided in the room, replenished every day - not just a couple of manky apples which gradually go soft during your stay. I think the rates are competitive when you consider the level of service, and what is included. It is different to many other places you will have stayed, but when you are next in London I do recommend you give it a try

We had an enjoyable stay at Hotel 41 while we were recently in London. We were thoroughly impressed with the impeccable service and location of the property. Monika and the rest of the team was absolutely wonderful and helpful in every way. They took care of many of our reservations and had insightful recommendations. There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing! If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place for you. This is a quiet and relaxed boutique hotel that allows you to unwind after a day in the busy city. We loved it! We will stay here again on our next visit to London. Room Tip: If you can, reserve the suite that connects to the sitting room See more room tips

My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41. From the moment we checked in, they made us feel so at home. We had lost our luggage and they were incredibly gracious & kind about helping us get some supplies. The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit.

Cannot explain how luxurious my 2 night break away was. Fantastic hotel, worth every penny and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Expensive rooms but would only be a problem if the room was not worth of price. Will certainly return in near future!

The best hotel I have stayed in - also one of the most expensive hotels I have stayed in but worth every penny. I wanted somewhere very special for our anniversary and looking on tripadvisor this seemed to fit the bill. I was not disappointed the staff were very attentive nothing was a bother to them. Although it seemed expensive everything was included including champagne on arrival, snacks in the day and breakfast. The only problem is if I now take my wife anywhere else she will be disappointed.

This was a special 2 night break for our wedding anniversary . This is the best hotel I've stayed in . Fab fab, nothing was any trouble, great breakfasts and service, attention to detail on everything. From booking in with champagne to afternoon tea, I can honestly say there was nothing to fault beautiful. Would return at any given chance, expensive but was a wonderful treat.

Having combed Trip Advisor for suggestions where to stay for my wife's birthday, it was soon apparent that this hotel was somewhere very special to those who stayed here. The hotel staff made us feel so welcome it was just the spot to celebrate. Nothing was too much trouble, always on hand to help but never over-zealous, giving time and space to enjoy the lovely atmosphere in the hotel. The 'Plunder the Pantry' was a revelation, another very positive plus as it allowed an opportunity to sit and relax between trips out to enjoy the city. There can be no doubt that this is one of the very best places (if not the best) to stay if you are in London.

This was our second stay here and this time we chose a junior suite (stayed in the magnificent conservatory suite on our honeymoon) and found it to be very spacious and very comfortable. Service was very smooth and everyone was eager to please (continually being offered tea/coffee/champagne). We were warmly and royally welcomed back by Monica, Lauren and Juliana. Prior to checking in, we stopped in to say hi and was offered champagne and had a nice chat with Stef. Breakfast was excellent as was plundering the pantry every evening. The romantic rose turn down one evening with all the candles was very special and romantic. I don't know what else to add from our previous review and what others have said, except we plan to stay here on our annual family visit to the UK. See you next May. Room Tip: Rooms at the back tend to be quieter given all the construction in the area. See more room tips

Greeted on our arrival by friendly staff & taken to the Executive Lounge where we were served a glass of champagne. Escorted to our room only to find out that we had been upgraded to a fabulous room. Inside a congratulations cake & sweets. We had canapÃ©s & plunder the pantry, then we went back to the room to find evening turn down, candles, rose petals & music. I was very emotional. Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41. Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere. We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave. Made a promise to each other, that when we come back to England, we stay here again. Treat yourself & stay here, you will fall in love as well. Thank you to all the staff for making our special celebration even more wonderful.

We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in May of this year and again in August. We love this hotel. The service is fabulous lead by the wonderful, Lauren. All of the staff was so friendly and helpful. All requests were filled - they got our tickets for everything we wanted to do and made all our dinner reservations. We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good! Great canapÃ©s at cocktail time in the lounge. The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city. Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41.

Monika and the rest of the team was absolutely wonderful and helpful in every way. They took care of many of our reservations and had insightful recommendations. There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing! If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place for you. This is a quiet and relaxed boutique hotel that allows you to unwind after a day in the busy city. We loved it! We will stay here again on our next visit to London. Room Tip: If you can, reserve the suite that connects to the sitting room See more room tips

My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41. From the moment we checked in, they made us feel so at home. We had lost our luggage and they were incredibly gracious & kind about helping us get some supplies. The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit.

Cannot explain how luxurious my 2 night break away was. Fantastic hotel, worth every penny and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Expensive rooms but would only be a problem if the room was not worth of price. Will certainly return in near future!

The best hotel I have stayed in - also one of the most expensive hotels I have stayed in but worth every penny. I wanted somewhere very special for our anniversary and looking on tripadvisor this seemed to fit the bill. I was not disappointed the staff were very attentive nothing was a bother to them. Although it seemed expensive everything was included including champagne on arrival, snacks in the day and breakfast. The only problem is if I now take my wife anywhere else she will be disappointed.

This was a special 2 night break for our wedding anniversary . This is the best hotel I've stayed in . Fab fab, nothing was any trouble, great breakfasts and service, attention to detail on everything. From booking in with champagne to afternoon tea, I can honestly say there was nothing to fault beautiful. Would return at any given chance, expensive but was a wonderful treat.

Having combed Trip Advisor for suggestions where to stay for my wife's birthday, it was soon apparent that this hotel was somewhere very special to those who stayed here. The hotel staff made us feel so welcome it was just the spot to celebrate. Nothing was too much trouble, always on hand to help but never over-zealous, giving time and space to enjoy the lovely atmosphere in the hotel. The 'Plunder the Pantry' was a revelation, another very positive plus as it allowed an opportunity to sit and relax between trips out to enjoy the city. There can be no doubt that this is one of the very best places (if not the best) to stay if you are in London.

This was our second stay here and this time we chose a junior suite (stayed in the magnificent conservatory suite on our honeymoon) and found it to be very spacious and very comfortable. Service was very smooth and everyone was eager to please (continually being offered tea/coffee/champagne). We were warmly and royally welcomed back by Monica, Lauren and Juliana. Prior to checking in, we stopped in to say hi and was offered champagne and had a nice chat with Stef. Breakfast was excellent as was plundering the pantry every evening. The romantic rose turn down one evening with all the candles was very special and romantic. I don't know what else to add from our previous review and what others have said, except we plan to stay here on our annual family visit to the UK. See you next May. Room Tip: Rooms at the back tend to be quieter given all the construction in the area. See more room tips

Greeted on our arrival by friendly staff & taken to the Executive Lounge where we were served a glass of champagne. Escorted to our room only to find out that we had been upgraded to a fabulous room. Inside a congratulations cake & sweets. We had canapÃ©s & plunder the pantry, then we went back to the room to find evening turn down, candles, rose petals & music. I was very emotional. Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41. Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere. We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave. Made a promise to each other, that when we come back to England, we stay here again. Treat yourself & stay here, you will fall in love as well. Thank you to all the staff for making our special celebration even more wonderful.

We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in May of this year and again in August. We love this hotel. The service is fabulous lead by the wonderful, Lauren. All of the staff was so friendly and helpful. All requests were filled - they got our tickets for everything we wanted to do and made all our dinner reservations. We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good! Great canapÃ©s at cocktail time in the lounge. The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city. Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41.

This is a small boutique hotel with outstanding service. It's quirky and individual and will not appeal to everyone, but I really like it. The interior is all wood, brass and mirrors, and the heart is the executive lounge which functions as reception, bar. lounge and restaurant. The relatively small number of rooms allows them to offer a very individual service. The breakfast is wonderful, with a wide range of hot options to supplement the cold buffet. In the evening substantial snacks and drinks are included in the rate. Rooms are all very individual -I have stayed in three different ones. Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one. But not a big issue for me as I am generally out during the day anyway The rooms are very well equipped, as are the bathrooms, which have incredibly powerful showers. Delicious fresh fruit was provided in the room, replenished every day - not just a couple of manky apples which gradually go soft during your stay. I think the rates are competitive when you consider the level of service, and what is included. It is different to many other places you will have stayed, but when you are next in London I do recommend you give it a try

We had lost our luggage and they were incredibly gracious & kind about helping us get some supplies. The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit.

Cannot explain how luxurious my 2 night break away was. Fantastic hotel, worth every penny and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Expensive rooms but would only be a problem if the room was not worth of price. Will certainly return in near future!

The best hotel I have stayed in - also one of the most expensive hotels I have stayed in but worth every penny. I wanted somewhere very special for our anniversary and looking on tripadvisor this seemed to fit the bill. I was not disappointed the staff were very attentive nothing was a bother to them. Although it seemed expensive everything was included including champagne on arrival, snacks in the day and breakfast. The only problem is if I now take my wife anywhere else she will be disappointed.

This was a special 2 night break for our wedding anniversary . This is the best hotel I've stayed in . Fab fab, nothing was any trouble, great breakfasts and service, attention to detail on everything. From booking in with champagne to afternoon tea, I can honestly say there was nothing to fault beautiful. Would return at any given chance, expensive but was a wonderful treat.

Having combed Trip Advisor for suggestions where to stay for my wife's birthday, it was soon apparent that this hotel was somewhere very special to those who stayed here. The hotel staff made us feel so welcome it was just the spot to celebrate. Nothing was too much trouble, always on hand to help but never over-zealous, giving time and space to enjoy the lovely atmosphere in the hotel. The 'Plunder the Pantry' was a revelation, another very positive plus as it allowed an opportunity to sit and relax between trips out to enjoy the city. There can be no doubt that this is one of the very best places (if not the best) to stay if you are in London.

This was our second stay here and this time we chose a junior suite (stayed in the magnificent conservatory suite on our honeymoon) and found it to be very spacious and very comfortable. Service was very smooth and everyone was eager to please (continually being offered tea/coffee/champagne). We were warmly and royally welcomed back by Monica, Lauren and Juliana. Prior to checking in, we stopped in to say hi and was offered champagne and had a nice chat with Stef. Breakfast was excellent as was plundering the pantry every evening. The romantic rose turn down one evening with all the candles was very special and romantic. I don't know what else to add from our previous review and what others have said, except we plan to stay here on our annual family visit to the UK. See you next May. Room Tip: Rooms at the back tend to be quieter given all the construction in the area. See more room tips

Greeted on our arrival by friendly staff & taken to the Executive Lounge where we were served a glass of champagne. Escorted to our room only to find out that we had been upgraded to a fabulous room. Inside a congratulations cake & sweets. We had canapÃ©s & plunder the pantry, then we went back to the room to find evening turn down, candles, rose petals & music. I was very emotional. Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41. Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere. We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave. Made a promise to each other, that when we come back to England, we stay here again. Treat yourself & stay here, you will fall in love as well. Thank you to all the staff for making our special celebration even more wonderful.

We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in May of this year and again in August. We love this hotel. The service is fabulous lead by the wonderful, Lauren. All of the staff was so friendly and helpful. All requests were filled - they got our tickets for everything we wanted to do and made all our dinner reservations. We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good! Great canapÃ©s at cocktail time in the lounge. The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city. Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41.

This is a small boutique hotel with outstanding service. It's quirky and individual and will not appeal to everyone, but I really like it. The interior is all wood, brass and mirrors, and the heart is the executive lounge which functions as reception, bar. lounge and restaurant. The relatively small number of rooms allows them to offer a very individual service. The breakfast is wonderful, with a wide range of hot options to supplement the cold buffet. In the evening substantial snacks and drinks are included in the rate. Rooms are all very individual -I have stayed in three different ones. Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one. But not a big issue for me as I am generally out during the day anyway The rooms are very well equipped, as are the bathrooms, which have incredibly powerful showers. Delicious fresh fruit was provided in the room, replenished every day - not just a couple of manky apples which gradually go soft during your stay. I think the rates are competitive when you consider the level of service, and what is included. It is different to many other places you will have stayed, but when you are next in London I do recommend you give it a try

We had an enjoyable stay at Hotel 41 while we were recently in London. We were thoroughly impressed with the impeccable service and location of the property. Monika and the rest of the team was absolutely wonderful and helpful in every way. They took care of many of our reservations and had insightful recommendations. There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing! If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place for you. This is a quiet and relaxed boutique hotel that allows you to unwind after a day in the busy city. We loved it! We will stay here again on our next visit to London.

I wanted somewhere very special for our anniversary and looking on tripadvisor this seemed to fit the bill. I was not disappointed the staff were very attentive nothing was a bother to them. Although it seemed expensive everything was included including champagne on arrival, snacks in the day and breakfast. The only problem is if I now take my wife anywhere else she will be disappointed.

This was a special 2 night break for our wedding anniversary . This is the best hotel I've stayed in . Fab fab, nothing was any trouble, great breakfasts and service, attention to detail on everything. From booking in with champagne to afternoon tea, I can honestly say there was nothing to fault beautiful. Would return at any given chance, expensive but was a wonderful treat.

Having combed Trip Advisor for suggestions where to stay for my wife's birthday, it was soon apparent that this hotel was somewhere very special to those who stayed here. The hotel staff made us feel so welcome it was just the spot to celebrate. Nothing was too much trouble, always on hand to help but never over-zealous, giving time and space to enjoy the lovely atmosphere in the hotel. The 'Plunder the Pantry' was a revelation, another very positive plus as it allowed an opportunity to sit and relax between trips out to enjoy the city. There can be no doubt that this is one of the very best places (if not the best) to stay if you are in London.

This was our second stay here and this time we chose a junior suite (stayed in the magnificent conservatory suite on our honeymoon) and found it to be very spacious and very comfortable. Service was very smooth and everyone was eager to please (continually being offered tea/coffee/champagne). We were warmly and royally welcomed back by Monica, Lauren and Juliana. Prior to checking in, we stopped in to say hi and was offered champagne and had a nice chat with Stef. Breakfast was excellent as was plundering the pantry every evening. The romantic rose turn down one evening with all the candles was very special and romantic. I don't know what else to add from our previous review and what others have said, except we plan to stay here on our annual family visit to the UK. See you next May. Room Tip: Rooms at the back tend to be quieter given all the construction in the area. See more room tips

Greeted on our arrival by friendly staff & taken to the Executive Lounge where we were served a glass of champagne. Escorted to our room only to find out that we had been upgraded to a fabulous room. Inside a congratulations cake & sweets. We had canapÃ©s & plunder the pantry, then we went back to the room to find evening turn down, candles, rose petals & music. I was very emotional. Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41. Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere. We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave. Made a promise to each other, that when we come back to England, we stay here again. Treat yourself & stay here, you will fall in love as well. Thank you to all the staff for making our special celebration even more wonderful.

We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in May of this year and again in August. We love this hotel. The service is fabulous lead by the wonderful, Lauren. All of the staff was so friendly and helpful. All requests were filled - they got our tickets for everything we wanted to do and made all our dinner reservations. We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good! Great canapÃ©s at cocktail time in the lounge. The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city. Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41.

This is a small boutique hotel with outstanding service. It's quirky and individual and will not appeal to everyone, but I really like it. The interior is all wood, brass and mirrors, and the heart is the executive lounge which functions as reception, bar. lounge and restaurant. The relatively small number of rooms allows them to offer a very individual service. The breakfast is wonderful, with a wide range of hot options to supplement the cold buffet. In the evening substantial snacks and drinks are included in the rate. Rooms are all very individual -I have stayed in three different ones. Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one. But not a big issue for me as I am generally out during the day anyway The rooms are very well equipped, as are the bathrooms, which have incredibly powerful showers. Delicious fresh fruit was provided in the room, replenished every day - not just a couple of manky apples which gradually go soft during your stay. I think the rates are competitive when you consider the level of service, and what is included. It is different to many other places you will have stayed, but when you are next in London I do recommend you give it a try

We had an enjoyable stay at Hotel 41 while we were recently in London. We were thoroughly impressed with the impeccable service and location of the property. Monika and the rest of the team was absolutely wonderful and helpful in every way. They took care of many of our reservations and had insightful recommendations. There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing! If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place for you. This is a quiet and relaxed boutique hotel that allows you to unwind after a day in the busy city. We loved it! We will stay here again on our next visit to London. Room Tip: If you can, reserve the suite that connects to the sitting room See more room tips

My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41. From the moment we checked in, they made us feel so at home. We had lost our luggage and they were incredibly gracious & kind about helping us get some supplies. The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit.

The hotel staff made us feel so welcome it was just the spot to celebrate. Nothing was too much trouble, always on hand to help but never over-zealous, giving time and space to enjoy the lovely atmosphere in the hotel. The 'Plunder the Pantry' was a revelation, another very positive plus as it allowed an opportunity to sit and relax between trips out to enjoy the city. There can be no doubt that this is one of the very best places (if not the best) to stay if you are in London.

This was our second stay here and this time we chose a junior suite (stayed in the magnificent conservatory suite on our honeymoon) and found it to be very spacious and very comfortable. Service was very smooth and everyone was eager to please (continually being offered tea/coffee/champagne). We were warmly and royally welcomed back by Monica, Lauren and Juliana. Prior to checking in, we stopped in to say hi and was offered champagne and had a nice chat with Stef. Breakfast was excellent as was plundering the pantry every evening. The romantic rose turn down one evening with all the candles was very special and romantic. I don't know what else to add from our previous review and what others have said, except we plan to stay here on our annual family visit to the UK. See you next May. Room Tip: Rooms at the back tend to be quieter given all the construction in the area. See more room tips

Greeted on our arrival by friendly staff & taken to the Executive Lounge where we were served a glass of champagne. Escorted to our room only to find out that we had been upgraded to a fabulous room. Inside a congratulations cake & sweets. We had canapÃ©s & plunder the pantry, then we went back to the room to find evening turn down, candles, rose petals & music. I was very emotional. Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41. Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere. We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave. Made a promise to each other, that when we come back to England, we stay here again. Treat yourself & stay here, you will fall in love as well. Thank you to all the staff for making our special celebration even more wonderful.

We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in May of this year and again in August. We love this hotel. The service is fabulous lead by the wonderful, Lauren. All of the staff was so friendly and helpful. All requests were filled - they got our tickets for everything we wanted to do and made all our dinner reservations. We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good! Great canapÃ©s at cocktail time in the lounge. The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city. Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41.

This is a small boutique hotel with outstanding service. It's quirky and individual and will not appeal to everyone, but I really like it. The interior is all wood, brass and mirrors, and the heart is the executive lounge which functions as reception, bar. lounge and restaurant. The relatively small number of rooms allows them to offer a very individual service. The breakfast is wonderful, with a wide range of hot options to supplement the cold buffet. In the evening substantial snacks and drinks are included in the rate. Rooms are all very individual -I have stayed in three different ones. Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one. But not a big issue for me as I am generally out during the day anyway The rooms are very well equipped, as are the bathrooms, which have incredibly powerful showers. Delicious fresh fruit was provided in the room, replenished every day - not just a couple of manky apples which gradually go soft during your stay. I think the rates are competitive when you consider the level of service, and what is included. It is different to many other places you will have stayed, but when you are next in London I do recommend you give it a try

We had an enjoyable stay at Hotel 41 while we were recently in London. We were thoroughly impressed with the impeccable service and location of the property. Monika and the rest of the team was absolutely wonderful and helpful in every way. They took care of many of our reservations and had insightful recommendations. There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing! If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place for you. This is a quiet and relaxed boutique hotel that allows you to unwind after a day in the busy city. We loved it! We will stay here again on our next visit to London. Room Tip: If you can, reserve the suite that connects to the sitting room See more room tips

My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41. From the moment we checked in, they made us feel so at home. We had lost our luggage and they were incredibly gracious & kind about helping us get some supplies. The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit.

Cannot explain how luxurious my 2 night break away was. Fantastic hotel, worth every penny and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Expensive rooms but would only be a problem if the room was not worth of price. Will certainly return in near future!

The best hotel I have stayed in - also one of the most expensive hotels I have stayed in but worth every penny. I wanted somewhere very special for our anniversary and looking on tripadvisor this seemed to fit the bill. I was not disappointed the staff were very attentive nothing was a bother to them. Although it seemed expensive everything was included including champagne on arrival, snacks in the day and breakfast. The only problem is if I now take my wife anywhere else she will be disappointed.

Prior to checking in, we stopped in to say hi and was offered champagne and had a nice chat with Stef. Breakfast was excellent as was plundering the pantry every evening. The romantic rose turn down one evening with all the candles was very special and romantic. I don't know what else to add from our previous review and what others have said, except we plan to stay here on our annual family visit to the UK. See you next May. Room Tip: Rooms at the back tend to be quieter given all the construction in the area. See more room tips

Greeted on our arrival by friendly staff & taken to the Executive Lounge where we were served a glass of champagne. Escorted to our room only to find out that we had been upgraded to a fabulous room. Inside a congratulations cake & sweets. We had canapÃ©s & plunder the pantry, then we went back to the room to find evening turn down, candles, rose petals & music. I was very emotional. Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41. Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere. We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave. Made a promise to each other, that when we come back to England, we stay here again. Treat yourself & stay here, you will fall in love as well. Thank you to all the staff for making our special celebration even more wonderful.

We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in May of this year and again in August. We love this hotel. The service is fabulous lead by the wonderful, Lauren. All of the staff was so friendly and helpful. All requests were filled - they got our tickets for everything we wanted to do and made all our dinner reservations. We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good! Great canapÃ©s at cocktail time in the lounge. The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city. Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41.

This is a small boutique hotel with outstanding service. It's quirky and individual and will not appeal to everyone, but I really like it. The interior is all wood, brass and mirrors, and the heart is the executive lounge which functions as reception, bar. lounge and restaurant. The relatively small number of rooms allows them to offer a very individual service. The breakfast is wonderful, with a wide range of hot options to supplement the cold buffet. In the evening substantial snacks and drinks are included in the rate. Rooms are all very individual -I have stayed in three different ones. Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one. But not a big issue for me as I am generally out during the day anyway The rooms are very well equipped, as are the bathrooms, which have incredibly powerful showers. Delicious fresh fruit was provided in the room, replenished every day - not just a couple of manky apples which gradually go soft during your stay. I think the rates are competitive when you consider the level of service, and what is included. It is different to many other places you will have stayed, but when you are next in London I do recommend you give it a try

We had an enjoyable stay at Hotel 41 while we were recently in London. We were thoroughly impressed with the impeccable service and location of the property. Monika and the rest of the team was absolutely wonderful and helpful in every way. They took care of many of our reservations and had insightful recommendations. There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing! If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place for you. This is a quiet and relaxed boutique hotel that allows you to unwind after a day in the busy city. We loved it! We will stay here again on our next visit to London. Room Tip: If you can, reserve the suite that connects to the sitting room See more room tips

My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41. From the moment we checked in, they made us feel so at home. We had lost our luggage and they were incredibly gracious & kind about helping us get some supplies. The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit.

Cannot explain how luxurious my 2 night break away was. Fantastic hotel, worth every penny and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Expensive rooms but would only be a problem if the room was not worth of price. Will certainly return in near future!

The best hotel I have stayed in - also one of the most expensive hotels I have stayed in but worth every penny. I wanted somewhere very special for our anniversary and looking on tripadvisor this seemed to fit the bill. I was not disappointed the staff were very attentive nothing was a bother to them. Although it seemed expensive everything was included including champagne on arrival, snacks in the day and breakfast. The only problem is if I now take my wife anywhere else she will be disappointed.

This was a special 2 night break for our wedding anniversary . This is the best hotel I've stayed in . Fab fab, nothing was any trouble, great breakfasts and service, attention to detail on everything. From booking in with champagne to afternoon tea, I can honestly say there was nothing to fault beautiful. Would return at any given chance, expensive but was a wonderful treat.

Having combed Trip Advisor for suggestions where to stay for my wife's birthday, it was soon apparent that this hotel was somewhere very special to those who stayed here. The hotel staff made us feel so welcome it was just the spot to celebrate. Nothing was too much trouble, always on hand to help but never over-zealous, giving time and space to enjoy the lovely atmosphere in the hotel. The 'Plunder the Pantry' was a revelation, another very positive plus as it allowed an opportunity to sit and relax between trips out to enjoy the city. There can be no doubt that this is one of the very best places (if not the best) to stay if you are in London.

Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41. Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere. We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave. Made a promise to each other, that when we come back to England, we stay here again. Treat yourself & stay here, you will fall in love as well. Thank you to all the staff for making our special celebration even more wonderful.

We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in May of this year and again in August. We love this hotel. The service is fabulous lead by the wonderful, Lauren. All of the staff was so friendly and helpful. All requests were filled - they got our tickets for everything we wanted to do and made all our dinner reservations. We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good! Great canapÃ©s at cocktail time in the lounge. The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city. Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41.

This is a small boutique hotel with outstanding service. It's quirky and individual and will not appeal to everyone, but I really like it. The interior is all wood, brass and mirrors, and the heart is the executive lounge which functions as reception, bar. lounge and restaurant. The relatively small number of rooms allows them to offer a very individual service. The breakfast is wonderful, with a wide range of hot options to supplement the cold buffet. In the evening substantial snacks and drinks are included in the rate. Rooms are all very individual -I have stayed in three different ones. Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one. But not a big issue for me as I am generally out during the day anyway The rooms are very well equipped, as are the bathrooms, which have incredibly powerful showers. Delicious fresh fruit was provided in the room, replenished every day - not just a couple of manky apples which gradually go soft during your stay. I think the rates are competitive when you consider the level of service, and what is included. It is different to many other places you will have stayed, but when you are next in London I do recommend you give it a try

We had an enjoyable stay at Hotel 41 while we were recently in London. We were thoroughly impressed with the impeccable service and location of the property. Monika and the rest of the team was absolutely wonderful and helpful in every way. They took care of many of our reservations and had insightful recommendations. There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing! If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place for you. This is a quiet and relaxed boutique hotel that allows you to unwind after a day in the busy city. We loved it! We will stay here again on our next visit to London.

My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41. From the moment we checked in, they made us feel so at home. We had lost our luggage and they were incredibly gracious & kind about helping us get some supplies. The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit.

Cannot explain how luxurious my 2 night break away was. Fantastic hotel, worth every penny and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Expensive rooms but would only be a problem if the room was not worth of price. Will certainly return in near future!

The best hotel I have stayed in - also one of the most expensive hotels I have stayed in but worth every penny. I wanted somewhere very special for our anniversary and looking on tripadvisor this seemed to fit the bill. I was not disappointed the staff were very attentive nothing was a bother to them. Although it seemed expensive everything was included including champagne on arrival, snacks in the day and breakfast. The only problem is if I now take my wife anywhere else she will be disappointed.

This was a special 2 night break for our wedding anniversary . This is the best hotel I've stayed in . Fab fab, nothing was any trouble, great breakfasts and service, attention to detail on everything. From booking in with champagne to afternoon tea, I can honestly say there was nothing to fault beautiful. Would return at any given chance, expensive but was a wonderful treat.

Having combed Trip Advisor for suggestions where to stay for my wife's birthday, it was soon apparent that this hotel was somewhere very special to those who stayed here. The hotel staff made us feel so welcome it was just the spot to celebrate. Nothing was too much trouble, always on hand to help but never over-zealous, giving time and space to enjoy the lovely atmosphere in the hotel. The 'Plunder the Pantry' was a revelation, another very positive plus as it allowed an opportunity to sit and relax between trips out to enjoy the city. There can be no doubt that this is one of the very best places (if not the best) to stay if you are in London.

This was our second stay here and this time we chose a junior suite (stayed in the magnificent conservatory suite on our honeymoon) and found it to be very spacious and very comfortable. Service was very smooth and everyone was eager to please (continually being offered tea/coffee/champagne). We were warmly and royally welcomed back by Monica, Lauren and Juliana. Prior to checking in, we stopped in to say hi and was offered champagne and had a nice chat with Stef. Breakfast was excellent as was plundering the pantry every evening. The romantic rose turn down one evening with all the candles was very special and romantic. I don't know what else to add from our previous review and what others have said, except we plan to stay here on our annual family visit to the UK. See you next May.

We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good! Great canapÃ©s at cocktail time in the lounge. The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city. Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41.

This is a small boutique hotel with outstanding service. It's quirky and individual and will not appeal to everyone, but I really like it. The interior is all wood, brass and mirrors, and the heart is the executive lounge which functions as reception, bar. lounge and restaurant. The relatively small number of rooms allows them to offer a very individual service. The breakfast is wonderful, with a wide range of hot options to supplement the cold buffet. In the evening substantial snacks and drinks are included in the rate. Rooms are all very individual -I have stayed in three different ones. Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one. But not a big issue for me as I am generally out during the day anyway The rooms are very well equipped, as are the bathrooms, which have incredibly powerful showers. Delicious fresh fruit was provided in the room, replenished every day - not just a couple of manky apples which gradually go soft during your stay. I think the rates are competitive when you consider the level of service, and what is included. It is different to many other places you will have stayed, but when you are next in London I do recommend you give it a try

We had an enjoyable stay at Hotel 41 while we were recently in London. We were thoroughly impressed with the impeccable service and location of the property. Monika and the rest of the team was absolutely wonderful and helpful in every way. They took care of many of our reservations and had insightful recommendations. There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing! If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place for you. This is a quiet and relaxed boutique hotel that allows you to unwind after a day in the busy city. We loved it! We will stay here again on our next visit to London.

My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41. From the moment we checked in, they made us feel so at home. We had lost our luggage and they were incredibly gracious & kind about helping us get some supplies. The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit.

Cannot explain how luxurious my 2 night break away was. Fantastic hotel, worth every penny and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Expensive rooms but would only be a problem if the room was not worth of price. Will certainly return in near future!

The best hotel I have stayed in - also one of the most expensive hotels I have stayed in but worth every penny. I wanted somewhere very special for our anniversary and looking on tripadvisor this seemed to fit the bill. I was not disappointed the staff were very attentive nothing was a bother to them. Although it seemed expensive everything was included including champagne on arrival, snacks in the day and breakfast. The only problem is if I now take my wife anywhere else she will be disappointed.

This was a special 2 night break for our wedding anniversary . This is the best hotel I've stayed in . Fab fab, nothing was any trouble, great breakfasts and service, attention to detail on everything. From booking in with champagne to afternoon tea, I can honestly say there was nothing to fault beautiful. Would return at any given chance, expensive but was a wonderful treat.

Having combed Trip Advisor for suggestions where to stay for my wife's birthday, it was soon apparent that this hotel was somewhere very special to those who stayed here. The hotel staff made us feel so welcome it was just the spot to celebrate. Nothing was too much trouble, always on hand to help but never over-zealous, giving time and space to enjoy the lovely atmosphere in the hotel. The 'Plunder the Pantry' was a revelation, another very positive plus as it allowed an opportunity to sit and relax between trips out to enjoy the city. There can be no doubt that this is one of the very best places (if not the best) to stay if you are in London.

This was our second stay here and this time we chose a junior suite (stayed in the magnificent conservatory suite on our honeymoon) and found it to be very spacious and very comfortable. Service was very smooth and everyone was eager to please (continually being offered tea/coffee/champagne). We were warmly and royally welcomed back by Monica, Lauren and Juliana. Prior to checking in, we stopped in to say hi and was offered champagne and had a nice chat with Stef. Breakfast was excellent as was plundering the pantry every evening. The romantic rose turn down one evening with all the candles was very special and romantic. I don't know what else to add from our previous review and what others have said, except we plan to stay here on our annual family visit to the UK. See you next May. Room Tip: Rooms at the back tend to be quieter given all the construction in the area. See more room tips

Greeted on our arrival by friendly staff & taken to the Executive Lounge where we were served a glass of champagne. Escorted to our room only to find out that we had been upgraded to a fabulous room. Inside a congratulations cake & sweets. We had canapÃ©s & plunder the pantry, then we went back to the room to find evening turn down, candles, rose petals & music. I was very emotional. Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41. Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere. We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave. Made a promise to each other, that when we come back to England, we stay here again. Treat yourself & stay here, you will fall in love as well. Thank you to all the staff for making our special celebration even more wonderful.

Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one. But not a big issue for me as I am generally out during the day anyway The rooms are very well equipped, as are the bathrooms, which have incredibly powerful showers. Delicious fresh fruit was provided in the room, replenished every day - not just a couple of manky apples which gradually go soft during your stay. I think the rates are competitive when you consider the level of service, and what is included. It is different to many other places you will have stayed, but when you are next in London I do recommend you give it a try

We had an enjoyable stay at Hotel 41 while we were recently in London. We were thoroughly impressed with the impeccable service and location of the property. Monika and the rest of the team was absolutely wonderful and helpful in every way. They took care of many of our reservations and had insightful recommendations. There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing! If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place for you. This is a quiet and relaxed boutique hotel that allows you to unwind after a day in the busy city. We loved it! We will stay here again on our next visit to London. Room Tip: If you can, reserve the suite that connects to the sitting room See more room tips

My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41. From the moment we checked in, they made us feel so at home. We had lost our luggage and they were incredibly gracious & kind about helping us get some supplies. The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit.

Cannot explain how luxurious my 2 night break away was. Fantastic hotel, worth every penny and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Expensive rooms but would only be a problem if the room was not worth of price. Will certainly return in near future!

The best hotel I have stayed in - also one of the most expensive hotels I have stayed in but worth every penny. I wanted somewhere very special for our anniversary and looking on tripadvisor this seemed to fit the bill. I was not disappointed the staff were very attentive nothing was a bother to them. Although it seemed expensive everything was included including champagne on arrival, snacks in the day and breakfast. The only problem is if I now take my wife anywhere else she will be disappointed.

This was a special 2 night break for our wedding anniversary . This is the best hotel I've stayed in . Fab fab, nothing was any trouble, great breakfasts and service, attention to detail on everything. From booking in with champagne to afternoon tea, I can honestly say there was nothing to fault beautiful. Would return at any given chance, expensive but was a wonderful treat.

Having combed Trip Advisor for suggestions where to stay for my wife's birthday, it was soon apparent that this hotel was somewhere very special to those who stayed here. The hotel staff made us feel so welcome it was just the spot to celebrate. Nothing was too much trouble, always on hand to help but never over-zealous, giving time and space to enjoy the lovely atmosphere in the hotel. The 'Plunder the Pantry' was a revelation, another very positive plus as it allowed an opportunity to sit and relax between trips out to enjoy the city. There can be no doubt that this is one of the very best places (if not the best) to stay if you are in London.

This was our second stay here and this time we chose a junior suite (stayed in the magnificent conservatory suite on our honeymoon) and found it to be very spacious and very comfortable. Service was very smooth and everyone was eager to please (continually being offered tea/coffee/champagne). We were warmly and royally welcomed back by Monica, Lauren and Juliana. Prior to checking in, we stopped in to say hi and was offered champagne and had a nice chat with Stef. Breakfast was excellent as was plundering the pantry every evening. The romantic rose turn down one evening with all the candles was very special and romantic. I don't know what else to add from our previous review and what others have said, except we plan to stay here on our annual family visit to the UK. See you next May. Room Tip: Rooms at the back tend to be quieter given all the construction in the area. See more room tips

Greeted on our arrival by friendly staff & taken to the Executive Lounge where we were served a glass of champagne. Escorted to our room only to find out that we had been upgraded to a fabulous room. Inside a congratulations cake & sweets. We had canapÃ©s & plunder the pantry, then we went back to the room to find evening turn down, candles, rose petals & music. I was very emotional. Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41. Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere. We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave. Made a promise to each other, that when we come back to England, we stay here again. Treat yourself & stay here, you will fall in love as well. Thank you to all the staff for making our special celebration even more wonderful.

We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in May of this year and again in August. We love this hotel. The service is fabulous lead by the wonderful, Lauren. All of the staff was so friendly and helpful. All requests were filled - they got our tickets for everything we wanted to do and made all our dinner reservations. We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good! Great canapÃ©s at cocktail time in the lounge. The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city. Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41.

This is a small boutique hotel with outstanding service. It's quirky and individual and will not appeal to everyone, but I really like it. The interior is all wood, brass and mirrors, and the heart is the executive lounge which functions as reception, bar. lounge and restaurant.

There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing! If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place for you. This is a quiet and relaxed boutique hotel that allows you to unwind after a day in the busy city. We loved it! We will stay here again on our next visit to London.

My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41. From the moment we checked in, they made us feel so at home. We had lost our luggage and they were incredibly gracious & kind about helping us get some supplies. The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit.

Cannot explain how luxurious my 2 night break away was. Fantastic hotel, worth every penny and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Expensive rooms but would only be a problem if the room was not worth of price. Will certainly return in near future!

The best hotel I have stayed in - also one of the most expensive hotels I have stayed in but worth every penny. I wanted somewhere very special for our anniversary and looking on tripadvisor this seemed to fit the bill. I was not disappointed the staff were very attentive nothing was a bother to them. Although it seemed expensive everything was included including champagne on arrival, snacks in the day and breakfast. The only problem is if I now take my wife anywhere else she will be disappointed.

This was a special 2 night break for our wedding anniversary . This is the best hotel I've stayed in . Fab fab, nothing was any trouble, great breakfasts and service, attention to detail on everything. From booking in with champagne to afternoon tea, I can honestly say there was nothing to fault beautiful. Would return at any given chance, expensive but was a wonderful treat.

Having combed Trip Advisor for suggestions where to stay for my wife's birthday, it was soon apparent that this hotel was somewhere very special to those who stayed here. The hotel staff made us feel so welcome it was just the spot to celebrate. Nothing was too much trouble, always on hand to help but never over-zealous, giving time and space to enjoy the lovely atmosphere in the hotel. The 'Plunder the Pantry' was a revelation, another very positive plus as it allowed an opportunity to sit and relax between trips out to enjoy the city. There can be no doubt that this is one of the very best places (if not the best) to stay if you are in London.

This was our second stay here and this time we chose a junior suite (stayed in the magnificent conservatory suite on our honeymoon) and found it to be very spacious and very comfortable. Service was very smooth and everyone was eager to please (continually being offered tea/coffee/champagne). We were warmly and royally welcomed back by Monica, Lauren and Juliana. Prior to checking in, we stopped in to say hi and was offered champagne and had a nice chat with Stef. Breakfast was excellent as was plundering the pantry every evening. The romantic rose turn down one evening with all the candles was very special and romantic. I don't know what else to add from our previous review and what others have said, except we plan to stay here on our annual family visit to the UK. See you next May. Room Tip: Rooms at the back tend to be quieter given all the construction in the area. See more room tips

Greeted on our arrival by friendly staff & taken to the Executive Lounge where we were served a glass of champagne. Escorted to our room only to find out that we had been upgraded to a fabulous room. Inside a congratulations cake & sweets. We had canapÃ©s & plunder the pantry, then we went back to the room to find evening turn down, candles, rose petals & music. I was very emotional. Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41. Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere. We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave. Made a promise to each other, that when we come back to England, we stay here again. Treat yourself & stay here, you will fall in love as well. Thank you to all the staff for making our special celebration even more wonderful.

We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in May of this year and again in August. We love this hotel. The service is fabulous lead by the wonderful, Lauren. All of the staff was so friendly and helpful. All requests were filled - they got our tickets for everything we wanted to do and made all our dinner reservations. We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good! Great canapÃ©s at cocktail time in the lounge. The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city. Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41.

This is a small boutique hotel with outstanding service. It's quirky and individual and will not appeal to everyone, but I really like it. The interior is all wood, brass and mirrors, and the heart is the executive lounge which functions as reception, bar. lounge and restaurant. The relatively small number of rooms allows them to offer a very individual service. The breakfast is wonderful, with a wide range of hot options to supplement the cold buffet. In the evening substantial snacks and drinks are included in the rate. Rooms are all very individual -I have stayed in three different ones. Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one. But not a big issue for me as I am generally out during the day anyway The rooms are very well equipped, as are the bathrooms, which have incredibly powerful showers. Delicious fresh fruit was provided in the room, replenished every day - not just a couple of manky apples which gradually go soft during your stay. I think the rates are competitive when you consider the level of service, and what is included. It is different to many other places you will have stayed, but when you are next in London I do recommend you give it a try

The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit.

Cannot explain how luxurious my 2 night break away was. Fantastic hotel, worth every penny and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Expensive rooms but would only be a problem if the room was not worth of price. Will certainly return in near future!

The best hotel I have stayed in - also one of the most expensive hotels I have stayed in but worth every penny. I wanted somewhere very special for our anniversary and looking on tripadvisor this seemed to fit the bill. I was not disappointed the staff were very attentive nothing was a bother to them. Although it seemed expensive everything was included including champagne on arrival, snacks in the day and breakfast. The only problem is if I now take my wife anywhere else she will be disappointed.

This was a special 2 night break for our wedding anniversary . This is the best hotel I've stayed in . Fab fab, nothing was any trouble, great breakfasts and service, attention to detail on everything. From booking in with champagne to afternoon tea, I can honestly say there was nothing to fault beautiful. Would return at any given chance, expensive but was a wonderful treat.

Having combed Trip Advisor for suggestions where to stay for my wife's birthday, it was soon apparent that this hotel was somewhere very special to those who stayed here. The hotel staff made us feel so welcome it was just the spot to celebrate. Nothing was too much trouble, always on hand to help but never over-zealous, giving time and space to enjoy the lovely atmosphere in the hotel. The 'Plunder the Pantry' was a revelation, another very positive plus as it allowed an opportunity to sit and relax between trips out to enjoy the city. There can be no doubt that this is one of the very best places (if not the best) to stay if you are in London.

This was our second stay here and this time we chose a junior suite (stayed in the magnificent conservatory suite on our honeymoon) and found it to be very spacious and very comfortable. Service was very smooth and everyone was eager to please (continually being offered tea/coffee/champagne). We were warmly and royally welcomed back by Monica, Lauren and Juliana. Prior to checking in, we stopped in to say hi and was offered champagne and had a nice chat with Stef. Breakfast was excellent as was plundering the pantry every evening. The romantic rose turn down one evening with all the candles was very special and romantic. I don't know what else to add from our previous review and what others have said, except we plan to stay here on our annual family visit to the UK. See you next May. Room Tip: Rooms at the back tend to be quieter given all the construction in the area. See more room tips

Greeted on our arrival by friendly staff & taken to the Executive Lounge where we were served a glass of champagne. Escorted to our room only to find out that we had been upgraded to a fabulous room. Inside a congratulations cake & sweets. We had canapÃ©s & plunder the pantry, then we went back to the room to find evening turn down, candles, rose petals & music. I was very emotional. Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41. Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere. We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave. Made a promise to each other, that when we come back to England, we stay here again. Treat yourself & stay here, you will fall in love as well. Thank you to all the staff for making our special celebration even more wonderful.

We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in May of this year and again in August. We love this hotel. The service is fabulous lead by the wonderful, Lauren. All of the staff was so friendly and helpful. All requests were filled - they got our tickets for everything we wanted to do and made all our dinner reservations. We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good! Great canapÃ©s at cocktail time in the lounge. The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city. Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41.

This is a small boutique hotel with outstanding service. It's quirky and individual and will not appeal to everyone, but I really like it. The interior is all wood, brass and mirrors, and the heart is the executive lounge which functions as reception, bar. lounge and restaurant. The relatively small number of rooms allows them to offer a very individual service. The breakfast is wonderful, with a wide range of hot options to supplement the cold buffet. In the evening substantial snacks and drinks are included in the rate. Rooms are all very individual -I have stayed in three different ones. Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one. But not a big issue for me as I am generally out during the day anyway The rooms are very well equipped, as are the bathrooms, which have incredibly powerful showers. Delicious fresh fruit was provided in the room, replenished every day - not just a couple of manky apples which gradually go soft during your stay. I think the rates are competitive when you consider the level of service, and what is included. It is different to many other places you will have stayed, but when you are next in London I do recommend you give it a try

We had an enjoyable stay at Hotel 41 while we were recently in London. We were thoroughly impressed with the impeccable service and location of the property. Monika and the rest of the team was absolutely wonderful and helpful in every way. They took care of many of our reservations and had insightful recommendations. There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing! If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place for you. This is a quiet and relaxed boutique hotel that allows you to unwind after a day in the busy city. We loved it! We will stay here again on our next visit to London.

Although it seemed expensive everything was included including champagne on arrival, snacks in the day and breakfast. The only problem is if I now take my wife anywhere else she will be disappointed.

This was a special 2 night break for our wedding anniversary . This is the best hotel I've stayed in . Fab fab, nothing was any trouble, great breakfasts and service, attention to detail on everything. From booking in with champagne to afternoon tea, I can honestly say there was nothing to fault beautiful. Would return at any given chance, expensive but was a wonderful treat.

Having combed Trip Advisor for suggestions where to stay for my wife's birthday, it was soon apparent that this hotel was somewhere very special to those who stayed here. The hotel staff made us feel so welcome it was just the spot to celebrate. Nothing was too much trouble, always on hand to help but never over-zealous, giving time and space to enjoy the lovely atmosphere in the hotel. The 'Plunder the Pantry' was a revelation, another very positive plus as it allowed an opportunity to sit and relax between trips out to enjoy the city. There can be no doubt that this is one of the very best places (if not the best) to stay if you are in London.

This was our second stay here and this time we chose a junior suite (stayed in the magnificent conservatory suite on our honeymoon) and found it to be very spacious and very comfortable. Service was very smooth and everyone was eager to please (continually being offered tea/coffee/champagne). We were warmly and royally welcomed back by Monica, Lauren and Juliana. Prior to checking in, we stopped in to say hi and was offered champagne and had a nice chat with Stef. Breakfast was excellent as was plundering the pantry every evening. The romantic rose turn down one evening with all the candles was very special and romantic. I don't know what else to add from our previous review and what others have said, except we plan to stay here on our annual family visit to the UK. See you next May. Room Tip: Rooms at the back tend to be quieter given all the construction in the area. See more room tips

Greeted on our arrival by friendly staff & taken to the Executive Lounge where we were served a glass of champagne. Escorted to our room only to find out that we had been upgraded to a fabulous room. Inside a congratulations cake & sweets. We had canapÃ©s & plunder the pantry, then we went back to the room to find evening turn down, candles, rose petals & music. I was very emotional. Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41. Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere. We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave. Made a promise to each other, that when we come back to England, we stay here again. Treat yourself & stay here, you will fall in love as well. Thank you to all the staff for making our special celebration even more wonderful.

We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in May of this year and again in August. We love this hotel. The service is fabulous lead by the wonderful, Lauren. All of the staff was so friendly and helpful. All requests were filled - they got our tickets for everything we wanted to do and made all our dinner reservations. We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good! Great canapÃ©s at cocktail time in the lounge. The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city. Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41.

This is a small boutique hotel with outstanding service. It's quirky and individual and will not appeal to everyone, but I really like it. The interior is all wood, brass and mirrors, and the heart is the executive lounge which functions as reception, bar. lounge and restaurant. The relatively small number of rooms allows them to offer a very individual service. The breakfast is wonderful, with a wide range of hot options to supplement the cold buffet. In the evening substantial snacks and drinks are included in the rate. Rooms are all very individual -I have stayed in three different ones. Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one. But not a big issue for me as I am generally out during the day anyway The rooms are very well equipped, as are the bathrooms, which have incredibly powerful showers. Delicious fresh fruit was provided in the room, replenished every day - not just a couple of manky apples which gradually go soft during your stay. I think the rates are competitive when you consider the level of service, and what is included. It is different to many other places you will have stayed, but when you are next in London I do recommend you give it a try

We had an enjoyable stay at Hotel 41 while we were recently in London. We were thoroughly impressed with the impeccable service and location of the property. Monika and the rest of the team was absolutely wonderful and helpful in every way. They took care of many of our reservations and had insightful recommendations. There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing! If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place for you. This is a quiet and relaxed boutique hotel that allows you to unwind after a day in the busy city. We loved it! We will stay here again on our next visit to London. Room Tip: If you can, reserve the suite that connects to the sitting room See more room tips

My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41. From the moment we checked in, they made us feel so at home. We had lost our luggage and they were incredibly gracious & kind about helping us get some supplies. The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit.

Cannot explain how luxurious my 2 night break away was. Fantastic hotel, worth every penny and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Expensive rooms but would only be a problem if the room was not worth of price. Will certainly return in near future!

The 'Plunder the Pantry' was a revelation, another very positive plus as it allowed an opportunity to sit and relax between trips out to enjoy the city. There can be no doubt that this is one of the very best places (if not the best) to stay if you are in London.

This was our second stay here and this time we chose a junior suite (stayed in the magnificent conservatory suite on our honeymoon) and found it to be very spacious and very comfortable. Service was very smooth and everyone was eager to please (continually being offered tea/coffee/champagne). We were warmly and royally welcomed back by Monica, Lauren and Juliana. Prior to checking in, we stopped in to say hi and was offered champagne and had a nice chat with Stef. Breakfast was excellent as was plundering the pantry every evening. The romantic rose turn down one evening with all the candles was very special and romantic. I don't know what else to add from our previous review and what others have said, except we plan to stay here on our annual family visit to the UK. See you next May. Room Tip: Rooms at the back tend to be quieter given all the construction in the area. See more room tips

Greeted on our arrival by friendly staff & taken to the Executive Lounge where we were served a glass of champagne. Escorted to our room only to find out that we had been upgraded to a fabulous room. Inside a congratulations cake & sweets. We had canapÃ©s & plunder the pantry, then we went back to the room to find evening turn down, candles, rose petals & music. I was very emotional. Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41. Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere. We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave. Made a promise to each other, that when we come back to England, we stay here again. Treat yourself & stay here, you will fall in love as well. Thank you to all the staff for making our special celebration even more wonderful.

We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in May of this year and again in August. We love this hotel. The service is fabulous lead by the wonderful, Lauren. All of the staff was so friendly and helpful. All requests were filled - they got our tickets for everything we wanted to do and made all our dinner reservations. We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good! Great canapÃ©s at cocktail time in the lounge. The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city. Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41.

This is a small boutique hotel with outstanding service. It's quirky and individual and will not appeal to everyone, but I really like it. The interior is all wood, brass and mirrors, and the heart is the executive lounge which functions as reception, bar. lounge and restaurant. The relatively small number of rooms allows them to offer a very individual service. The breakfast is wonderful, with a wide range of hot options to supplement the cold buffet. In the evening substantial snacks and drinks are included in the rate. Rooms are all very individual -I have stayed in three different ones. Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one. But not a big issue for me as I am generally out during the day anyway The rooms are very well equipped, as are the bathrooms, which have incredibly powerful showers. Delicious fresh fruit was provided in the room, replenished every day - not just a couple of manky apples which gradually go soft during your stay. I think the rates are competitive when you consider the level of service, and what is included. It is different to many other places you will have stayed, but when you are next in London I do recommend you give it a try

We had an enjoyable stay at Hotel 41 while we were recently in London. We were thoroughly impressed with the impeccable service and location of the property. Monika and the rest of the team was absolutely wonderful and helpful in every way. They took care of many of our reservations and had insightful recommendations. There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing! If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place for you. This is a quiet and relaxed boutique hotel that allows you to unwind after a day in the busy city. We loved it! We will stay here again on our next visit to London. Room Tip: If you can, reserve the suite that connects to the sitting room See more room tips

My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41. From the moment we checked in, they made us feel so at home. We had lost our luggage and they were incredibly gracious & kind about helping us get some supplies. The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit.

Cannot explain how luxurious my 2 night break away was. Fantastic hotel, worth every penny and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Expensive rooms but would only be a problem if the room was not worth of price. Will certainly return in near future!

The best hotel I have stayed in - also one of the most expensive hotels I have stayed in but worth every penny. I wanted somewhere very special for our anniversary and looking on tripadvisor this seemed to fit the bill. I was not disappointed the staff were very attentive nothing was a bother to them. Although it seemed expensive everything was included including champagne on arrival, snacks in the day and breakfast. The only problem is if I now take my wife anywhere else she will be disappointed.

This was a special 2 night break for our wedding anniversary . This is the best hotel I've stayed in . Fab fab, nothing was any trouble, great breakfasts and service, attention to detail on everything. From booking in with champagne to afternoon tea, I can honestly say there was nothing to fault beautiful. Would return at any given chance, expensive but was a wonderful treat.

Having combed Trip Advisor for suggestions where to stay for my wife's birthday, it was soon apparent that this hotel was somewhere very special to those who stayed here.

Room Tip: Rooms at the back tend to be quieter given all the construction in the area. See more room tips

Greeted on our arrival by friendly staff & taken to the Executive Lounge where we were served a glass of champagne. Escorted to our room only to find out that we had been upgraded to a fabulous room. Inside a congratulations cake & sweets. We had canapÃ©s & plunder the pantry, then we went back to the room to find evening turn down, candles, rose petals & music. I was very emotional. Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41. Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere. We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave. Made a promise to each other, that when we come back to England, we stay here again. Treat yourself & stay here, you will fall in love as well. Thank you to all the staff for making our special celebration even more wonderful.

We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in May of this year and again in August. We love this hotel. The service is fabulous lead by the wonderful, Lauren. All of the staff was so friendly and helpful. All requests were filled - they got our tickets for everything we wanted to do and made all our dinner reservations. We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good! Great canapÃ©s at cocktail time in the lounge. The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city. Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41.

This is a small boutique hotel with outstanding service. It's quirky and individual and will not appeal to everyone, but I really like it. The interior is all wood, brass and mirrors, and the heart is the executive lounge which functions as reception, bar. lounge and restaurant. The relatively small number of rooms allows them to offer a very individual service. The breakfast is wonderful, with a wide range of hot options to supplement the cold buffet. In the evening substantial snacks and drinks are included in the rate. Rooms are all very individual -I have stayed in three different ones. Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one. But not a big issue for me as I am generally out during the day anyway The rooms are very well equipped, as are the bathrooms, which have incredibly powerful showers. Delicious fresh fruit was provided in the room, replenished every day - not just a couple of manky apples which gradually go soft during your stay. I think the rates are competitive when you consider the level of service, and what is included. It is different to many other places you will have stayed, but when you are next in London I do recommend you give it a try

We had an enjoyable stay at Hotel 41 while we were recently in London. We were thoroughly impressed with the impeccable service and location of the property. Monika and the rest of the team was absolutely wonderful and helpful in every way. They took care of many of our reservations and had insightful recommendations. There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing! If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place for you. This is a quiet and relaxed boutique hotel that allows you to unwind after a day in the busy city. We loved it! We will stay here again on our next visit to London. Room Tip: If you can, reserve the suite that connects to the sitting room See more room tips

My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41. From the moment we checked in, they made us feel so at home. We had lost our luggage and they were incredibly gracious & kind about helping us get some supplies. The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit.

Cannot explain how luxurious my 2 night break away was. Fantastic hotel, worth every penny and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Expensive rooms but would only be a problem if the room was not worth of price. Will certainly return in near future!

The best hotel I have stayed in - also one of the most expensive hotels I have stayed in but worth every penny. I wanted somewhere very special for our anniversary and looking on tripadvisor this seemed to fit the bill. I was not disappointed the staff were very attentive nothing was a bother to them. Although it seemed expensive everything was included including champagne on arrival, snacks in the day and breakfast. The only problem is if I now take my wife anywhere else she will be disappointed.

This was a special 2 night break for our wedding anniversary . This is the best hotel I've stayed in . Fab fab, nothing was any trouble, great breakfasts and service, attention to detail on everything. From booking in with champagne to afternoon tea, I can honestly say there was nothing to fault beautiful. Would return at any given chance, expensive but was a wonderful treat.

Having combed Trip Advisor for suggestions where to stay for my wife's birthday, it was soon apparent that this hotel was somewhere very special to those who stayed here. The hotel staff made us feel so welcome it was just the spot to celebrate. Nothing was too much trouble, always on hand to help but never over-zealous, giving time and space to enjoy the lovely atmosphere in the hotel. The 'Plunder the Pantry' was a revelation, another very positive plus as it allowed an opportunity to sit and relax between trips out to enjoy the city. There can be no doubt that this is one of the very best places (if not the best) to stay if you are in London.

This was our second stay here and this time we chose a junior suite (stayed in the magnificent conservatory suite on our honeymoon) and found it to be very spacious and very comfortable. Service was very smooth and everyone was eager to please (continually being offered tea/coffee/champagne). We were warmly and royally welcomed back by Monica, Lauren and Juliana. Prior to checking in, we stopped in to say hi and was offered champagne and had a nice chat with Stef. Breakfast was excellent as was plundering the pantry every evening. The romantic rose turn down one evening with all the candles was very special and romantic.

We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in May of this year and again in August. We love this hotel. The service is fabulous lead by the wonderful, Lauren. All of the staff was so friendly and helpful. All requests were filled - they got our tickets for everything we wanted to do and made all our dinner reservations. We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good! Great canapÃ©s at cocktail time in the lounge. The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city. Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41.

This is a small boutique hotel with outstanding service. It's quirky and individual and will not appeal to everyone, but I really like it. The interior is all wood, brass and mirrors, and the heart is the executive lounge which functions as reception, bar. lounge and restaurant. The relatively small number of rooms allows them to offer a very individual service. The breakfast is wonderful, with a wide range of hot options to supplement the cold buffet. In the evening substantial snacks and drinks are included in the rate. Rooms are all very individual -I have stayed in three different ones. Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one. But not a big issue for me as I am generally out during the day anyway The rooms are very well equipped, as are the bathrooms, which have incredibly powerful showers. Delicious fresh fruit was provided in the room, replenished every day - not just a couple of manky apples which gradually go soft during your stay. I think the rates are competitive when you consider the level of service, and what is included. It is different to many other places you will have stayed, but when you are next in London I do recommend you give it a try

We had an enjoyable stay at Hotel 41 while we were recently in London. We were thoroughly impressed with the impeccable service and location of the property. Monika and the rest of the team was absolutely wonderful and helpful in every way. They took care of many of our reservations and had insightful recommendations. There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing! If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place for you. This is a quiet and relaxed boutique hotel that allows you to unwind after a day in the busy city. We loved it! We will stay here again on our next visit to London. Room Tip: If you can, reserve the suite that connects to the sitting room See more room tips

My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41. From the moment we checked in, they made us feel so at home. We had lost our luggage and they were incredibly gracious & kind about helping us get some supplies. The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit.

Cannot explain how luxurious my 2 night break away was. Fantastic hotel, worth every penny and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Expensive rooms but would only be a problem if the room was not worth of price. Will certainly return in near future!

The best hotel I have stayed in - also one of the most expensive hotels I have stayed in but worth every penny. I wanted somewhere very special for our anniversary and looking on tripadvisor this seemed to fit the bill. I was not disappointed the staff were very attentive nothing was a bother to them. Although it seemed expensive everything was included including champagne on arrival, snacks in the day and breakfast. The only problem is if I now take my wife anywhere else she will be disappointed.

This was a special 2 night break for our wedding anniversary . This is the best hotel I've stayed in . Fab fab, nothing was any trouble, great breakfasts and service, attention to detail on everything. From booking in with champagne to afternoon tea, I can honestly say there was nothing to fault beautiful. Would return at any given chance, expensive but was a wonderful treat.

Having combed Trip Advisor for suggestions where to stay for my wife's birthday, it was soon apparent that this hotel was somewhere very special to those who stayed here. The hotel staff made us feel so welcome it was just the spot to celebrate. Nothing was too much trouble, always on hand to help but never over-zealous, giving time and space to enjoy the lovely atmosphere in the hotel. The 'Plunder the Pantry' was a revelation, another very positive plus as it allowed an opportunity to sit and relax between trips out to enjoy the city. There can be no doubt that this is one of the very best places (if not the best) to stay if you are in London.

This was our second stay here and this time we chose a junior suite (stayed in the magnificent conservatory suite on our honeymoon) and found it to be very spacious and very comfortable. Service was very smooth and everyone was eager to please (continually being offered tea/coffee/champagne). We were warmly and royally welcomed back by Monica, Lauren and Juliana. Prior to checking in, we stopped in to say hi and was offered champagne and had a nice chat with Stef. Breakfast was excellent as was plundering the pantry every evening. The romantic rose turn down one evening with all the candles was very special and romantic. I don't know what else to add from our previous review and what others have said, except we plan to stay here on our annual family visit to the UK. See you next May. Room Tip: Rooms at the back tend to be quieter given all the construction in the area. See more room tips

Greeted on our arrival by friendly staff & taken to the Executive Lounge where we were served a glass of champagne. Escorted to our room only to find out that we had been upgraded to a fabulous room. Inside a congratulations cake & sweets. We had canapÃ©s & plunder the pantry, then we went back to the room to find evening turn down, candles, rose petals & music. I was very emotional. Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41. Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere. We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave.

In the evening substantial snacks and drinks are included in the rate. Rooms are all very individual -I have stayed in three different ones. Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one. But not a big issue for me as I am generally out during the day anyway The rooms are very well equipped, as are the bathrooms, which have incredibly powerful showers. Delicious fresh fruit was provided in the room, replenished every day - not just a couple of manky apples which gradually go soft during your stay. I think the rates are competitive when you consider the level of service, and what is included. It is different to many other places you will have stayed, but when you are next in London I do recommend you give it a try

We had an enjoyable stay at Hotel 41 while we were recently in London. We were thoroughly impressed with the impeccable service and location of the property. Monika and the rest of the team was absolutely wonderful and helpful in every way. They took care of many of our reservations and had insightful recommendations. There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing! If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place for you. This is a quiet and relaxed boutique hotel that allows you to unwind after a day in the busy city. We loved it! We will stay here again on our next visit to London. Room Tip: If you can, reserve the suite that connects to the sitting room See more room tips

My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41. From the moment we checked in, they made us feel so at home. We had lost our luggage and they were incredibly gracious & kind about helping us get some supplies. The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit.

Cannot explain how luxurious my 2 night break away was. Fantastic hotel, worth every penny and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Expensive rooms but would only be a problem if the room was not worth of price. Will certainly return in near future!

The best hotel I have stayed in - also one of the most expensive hotels I have stayed in but worth every penny. I wanted somewhere very special for our anniversary and looking on tripadvisor this seemed to fit the bill. I was not disappointed the staff were very attentive nothing was a bother to them. Although it seemed expensive everything was included including champagne on arrival, snacks in the day and breakfast. The only problem is if I now take my wife anywhere else she will be disappointed.

This was a special 2 night break for our wedding anniversary . This is the best hotel I've stayed in . Fab fab, nothing was any trouble, great breakfasts and service, attention to detail on everything. From booking in with champagne to afternoon tea, I can honestly say there was nothing to fault beautiful. Would return at any given chance, expensive but was a wonderful treat.

Having combed Trip Advisor for suggestions where to stay for my wife's birthday, it was soon apparent that this hotel was somewhere very special to those who stayed here. The hotel staff made us feel so welcome it was just the spot to celebrate. Nothing was too much trouble, always on hand to help but never over-zealous, giving time and space to enjoy the lovely atmosphere in the hotel. The 'Plunder the Pantry' was a revelation, another very positive plus as it allowed an opportunity to sit and relax between trips out to enjoy the city. There can be no doubt that this is one of the very best places (if not the best) to stay if you are in London.

This was our second stay here and this time we chose a junior suite (stayed in the magnificent conservatory suite on our honeymoon) and found it to be very spacious and very comfortable. Service was very smooth and everyone was eager to please (continually being offered tea/coffee/champagne). We were warmly and royally welcomed back by Monica, Lauren and Juliana. Prior to checking in, we stopped in to say hi and was offered champagne and had a nice chat with Stef. Breakfast was excellent as was plundering the pantry every evening. The romantic rose turn down one evening with all the candles was very special and romantic. I don't know what else to add from our previous review and what others have said, except we plan to stay here on our annual family visit to the UK. See you next May. Room Tip: Rooms at the back tend to be quieter given all the construction in the area. See more room tips

Greeted on our arrival by friendly staff & taken to the Executive Lounge where we were served a glass of champagne. Escorted to our room only to find out that we had been upgraded to a fabulous room. Inside a congratulations cake & sweets. We had canapÃ©s & plunder the pantry, then we went back to the room to find evening turn down, candles, rose petals & music. I was very emotional. Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41. Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere. We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave. Made a promise to each other, that when we come back to England, we stay here again. Treat yourself & stay here, you will fall in love as well. Thank you to all the staff for making our special celebration even more wonderful.

We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in May of this year and again in August. We love this hotel. The service is fabulous lead by the wonderful, Lauren. All of the staff was so friendly and helpful. All requests were filled - they got our tickets for everything we wanted to do and made all our dinner reservations. We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good! Great canapÃ©s at cocktail time in the lounge. The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city. Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41.

Monika and the rest of the team was absolutely wonderful and helpful in every way. They took care of many of our reservations and had insightful recommendations. There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing! If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place for you. This is a quiet and relaxed boutique hotel that allows you to unwind after a day in the busy city. We loved it! We will stay here again on our next visit to London. Room Tip: If you can, reserve the suite that connects to the sitting room See more room tips

My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41. From the moment we checked in, they made us feel so at home. We had lost our luggage and they were incredibly gracious & kind about helping us get some supplies. The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit.

Cannot explain how luxurious my 2 night break away was. Fantastic hotel, worth every penny and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Expensive rooms but would only be a problem if the room was not worth of price. Will certainly return in near future!

The best hotel I have stayed in - also one of the most expensive hotels I have stayed in but worth every penny. I wanted somewhere very special for our anniversary and looking on tripadvisor this seemed to fit the bill. I was not disappointed the staff were very attentive nothing was a bother to them. Although it seemed expensive everything was included including champagne on arrival, snacks in the day and breakfast. The only problem is if I now take my wife anywhere else she will be disappointed.

This was a special 2 night break for our wedding anniversary . This is the best hotel I've stayed in . Fab fab, nothing was any trouble, great breakfasts and service, attention to detail on everything. From booking in with champagne to afternoon tea, I can honestly say there was nothing to fault beautiful. Would return at any given chance, expensive but was a wonderful treat.

Having combed Trip Advisor for suggestions where to stay for my wife's birthday, it was soon apparent that this hotel was somewhere very special to those who stayed here. The hotel staff made us feel so welcome it was just the spot to celebrate. Nothing was too much trouble, always on hand to help but never over-zealous, giving time and space to enjoy the lovely atmosphere in the hotel. The 'Plunder the Pantry' was a revelation, another very positive plus as it allowed an opportunity to sit and relax between trips out to enjoy the city. There can be no doubt that this is one of the very best places (if not the best) to stay if you are in London.

This was our second stay here and this time we chose a junior suite (stayed in the magnificent conservatory suite on our honeymoon) and found it to be very spacious and very comfortable. Service was very smooth and everyone was eager to please (continually being offered tea/coffee/champagne). We were warmly and royally welcomed back by Monica, Lauren and Juliana. Prior to checking in, we stopped in to say hi and was offered champagne and had a nice chat with Stef. Breakfast was excellent as was plundering the pantry every evening. The romantic rose turn down one evening with all the candles was very special and romantic. I don't know what else to add from our previous review and what others have said, except we plan to stay here on our annual family visit to the UK. See you next May. Room Tip: Rooms at the back tend to be quieter given all the construction in the area. See more room tips

Greeted on our arrival by friendly staff & taken to the Executive Lounge where we were served a glass of champagne. Escorted to our room only to find out that we had been upgraded to a fabulous room. Inside a congratulations cake & sweets. We had canapÃ©s & plunder the pantry, then we went back to the room to find evening turn down, candles, rose petals & music. I was very emotional. Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41. Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere. We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave. Made a promise to each other, that when we come back to England, we stay here again. Treat yourself & stay here, you will fall in love as well. Thank you to all the staff for making our special celebration even more wonderful.

We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in May of this year and again in August. We love this hotel. The service is fabulous lead by the wonderful, Lauren. All of the staff was so friendly and helpful. All requests were filled - they got our tickets for everything we wanted to do and made all our dinner reservations. We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good! Great canapÃ©s at cocktail time in the lounge. The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city. Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41.

This is a small boutique hotel with outstanding service. It's quirky and individual and will not appeal to everyone, but I really like it. The interior is all wood, brass and mirrors, and the heart is the executive lounge which functions as reception, bar. lounge and restaurant. The relatively small number of rooms allows them to offer a very individual service. The breakfast is wonderful, with a wide range of hot options to supplement the cold buffet. In the evening substantial snacks and drinks are included in the rate. Rooms are all very individual -I have stayed in three different ones. Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one. But not a big issue for me as I am generally out during the day anyway The rooms are very well equipped, as are the bathrooms, which have incredibly powerful showers. Delicious fresh fruit was provided in the room, replenished every day - not just a couple of manky apples which gradually go soft during your stay. I think the rates are competitive when you consider the level of service, and what is included. It is different to many other places you will have stayed, but when you are next in London I do recommend you give it a try

We had lost our luggage and they were incredibly gracious & kind about helping us get some supplies. The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit.

Cannot explain how luxurious my 2 night break away was. Fantastic hotel, worth every penny and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Expensive rooms but would only be a problem if the room was not worth of price. Will certainly return in near future!

The best hotel I have stayed in - also one of the most expensive hotels I have stayed in but worth every penny. I wanted somewhere very special for our anniversary and looking on tripadvisor this seemed to fit the bill. I was not disappointed the staff were very attentive nothing was a bother to them. Although it seemed expensive everything was included including champagne on arrival, snacks in the day and breakfast. The only problem is if I now take my wife anywhere else she will be disappointed.

This was a special 2 night break for our wedding anniversary . This is the best hotel I've stayed in . Fab fab, nothing was any trouble, great breakfasts and service, attention to detail on everything. From booking in with champagne to afternoon tea, I can honestly say there was nothing to fault beautiful. Would return at any given chance, expensive but was a wonderful treat.

Having combed Trip Advisor for suggestions where to stay for my wife's birthday, it was soon apparent that this hotel was somewhere very special to those who stayed here. The hotel staff made us feel so welcome it was just the spot to celebrate. Nothing was too much trouble, always on hand to help but never over-zealous, giving time and space to enjoy the lovely atmosphere in the hotel. The 'Plunder the Pantry' was a revelation, another very positive plus as it allowed an opportunity to sit and relax between trips out to enjoy the city. There can be no doubt that this is one of the very best places (if not the best) to stay if you are in London.

This was our second stay here and this time we chose a junior suite (stayed in the magnificent conservatory suite on our honeymoon) and found it to be very spacious and very comfortable. Service was very smooth and everyone was eager to please (continually being offered tea/coffee/champagne). We were warmly and royally welcomed back by Monica, Lauren and Juliana. Prior to checking in, we stopped in to say hi and was offered champagne and had a nice chat with Stef. Breakfast was excellent as was plundering the pantry every evening. The romantic rose turn down one evening with all the candles was very special and romantic. I don't know what else to add from our previous review and what others have said, except we plan to stay here on our annual family visit to the UK. See you next May. Room Tip: Rooms at the back tend to be quieter given all the construction in the area. See more room tips

Greeted on our arrival by friendly staff & taken to the Executive Lounge where we were served a glass of champagne. Escorted to our room only to find out that we had been upgraded to a fabulous room. Inside a congratulations cake & sweets. We had canapÃ©s & plunder the pantry, then we went back to the room to find evening turn down, candles, rose petals & music. I was very emotional. Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41. Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere. We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave. Made a promise to each other, that when we come back to England, we stay here again. Treat yourself & stay here, you will fall in love as well. Thank you to all the staff for making our special celebration even more wonderful.

We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in May of this year and again in August. We love this hotel. The service is fabulous lead by the wonderful, Lauren. All of the staff was so friendly and helpful. All requests were filled - they got our tickets for everything we wanted to do and made all our dinner reservations. We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good! Great canapÃ©s at cocktail time in the lounge. The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city. Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41.

This is a small boutique hotel with outstanding service. It's quirky and individual and will not appeal to everyone, but I really like it. The interior is all wood, brass and mirrors, and the heart is the executive lounge which functions as reception, bar. lounge and restaurant. The relatively small number of rooms allows them to offer a very individual service. The breakfast is wonderful, with a wide range of hot options to supplement the cold buffet. In the evening substantial snacks and drinks are included in the rate. Rooms are all very individual -I have stayed in three different ones. Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one. But not a big issue for me as I am generally out during the day anyway The rooms are very well equipped, as are the bathrooms, which have incredibly powerful showers. Delicious fresh fruit was provided in the room, replenished every day - not just a couple of manky apples which gradually go soft during your stay. I think the rates are competitive when you consider the level of service, and what is included. It is different to many other places you will have stayed, but when you are next in London I do recommend you give it a try

We had an enjoyable stay at Hotel 41 while we were recently in London. We were thoroughly impressed with the impeccable service and location of the property. Monika and the rest of the team was absolutely wonderful and helpful in every way. They took care of many of our reservations and had insightful recommendations. There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing! If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place for you. This is a quiet and relaxed boutique hotel that allows you to unwind after a day in the busy city. We loved it! We will stay here again on our next visit to London.
