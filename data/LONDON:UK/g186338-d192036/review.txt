Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read.

The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream.

The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon.

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful .

The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special.

We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them.

The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect.

It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon.

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful .

The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special.

We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them.

The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect.

It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon.

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful .

The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special.

We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them.

The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect.

It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon.

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful .

The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special.

We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them.

The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect.

It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon.

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful .

The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special.

We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them.

The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect.

It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon.

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful .

The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special.

We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them.

The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect.

It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon.

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful .

The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special.

We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them.

The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect.

It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon.

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful .

The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special.

We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them.

The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect.

It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon.

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful .

The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them. I am pleased that you would have no hesitation about staying with us again and I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special.

We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden. Small canapÃ©s were brought round while the bar service and the hot food were very good. The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night. Room Tip: A room overlooking the garden is a must for a quiet night's sleep See more room tips

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special. Your kind comment that the staff, bedroom and breakfast in The Blue Door Bistro were of a high standard is most appreciated. We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read. I am delighted that you chose to return to the hotel to celebrate a 50th birthday. It is wonderful to know that you felt your room was spacious and that you liked the turndown service we provided. I am equally thrilled that you had the opportunity to experience our different dining areas including the Blue Door Bistro, Terrace Bar and afternoon tea option. Our team like to ensure that our guests have everything they need so it is wonderful to know that nothing was too much trouble for them, we are indeed very proud of them.

The celebratory cake was taken away to be sliced, but for the children present there were individual child-friendly cakes personally addressed. Meanwhile there had also been strawberries and cream. The sliced cake was brought back to be offered and boxes were provided for those who wanted to take a piece home. The staff were friendly and polite â not over-familiar, but not stiff. There was no dancing scheduled for this event, so I cannot comment on whether and how that would have been enabled if desired, but the event service which I experienced can be highly recommended â subject to the cost being OK: I was a guest!

We got married in central London in August 2014 and chose this hotel for our wedding night. It couldn't have been much better. We arrived after midnight and were given a warm welcome by the night staff. Our room was large and luxurious and it had been given the full rose petals on the bed and candles in the bath treatment. As a finishing touch, the hotel had left some complementary little bits of confectionery and box of delicious biscuits. We treated ourselves to the room service breakfast, which was excellent. If you're getting married in London and looking for somewhere to spend your wedding night, you don't need to look any further than this place. We will definitely be back, for our anniversary if not before.

We were lucky enough to make a return visit to this hotel recently and were not disappointed. It is in a great location for The British Museum and if you want to explore further it is within easy walking distance of Oxford Street and the West End for theatres. The staff are very attentive but discreet, breakfasts are fabulous, and a cocktail in the bar in the evening is a must. A room overlooking the gardens is a must for a peaceful night.

This is a lovely place to stay while visiting London. Literally right beside The British Museum it is close to Oxford Street, the Theatre district and a nice walk to Holborne Station and the Central and Picadilly Lines. Can't say enough about the staff here. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we felt welcomed. A special thanks to Paul who greeted us first, brought our bags to the room and showed us around the hotel- and especially to Paulas, who took car of us in the Mintagu's cozy bar and so generously gave us tips on using the underground and even gave us his Oyster Card to get us started! The breakfasts were well prepared and so enjoyed the smoothly of the day and the option of having carrot and beet juice ( yum) in the mornings. Our room,( though tiny) was well appointed and we could open the windows. The maids were quick to clean in the morning and there was a turn down service at night- a lovely touch. Thank you Montgue- you are a gem! Room Tip: We faced the street and were a bit worried about night noise but it wasn't an issue at all. We h... See more room tips

Great hotel with highly professional staff. From the doorman, concierge, front desk and housekeeping staff everyone we met was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable (a bit small but typical for European hotels). The hotel is also in a great location with many attractions within walking distance (including the fabulous British Museum which is right around the corner). I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again on my next trip to London.

Beautiful boutique hotel near Bloomsbury, Super service and lovely ambiance. Pretty gardens to enjoy a glass of their fine wine. Well situated for walking to most major attractions and close to Sicilian avenue for excellent coffee.

We stayed at Montague for two nights last year, so when circumstances led us to having as weeks holiday in London there was only one place I wanted to stay. It is in an excellent area to visit all the central attractions . The minute the door is opened it is obvious this is a special hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, cases are taken away and next seen in the bedroom, on this occasion our room was ready, last time we we served tea and biscuits until it was ready. The room wasn't very large but had everything we needed and was beautiful . Every member if staff goes out of their way to be helpful, The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice, a drink and chat in the bar on a nighttime is a must. I can't wait to return.

Just returned from a brilliant trip in London. The Montague made are stay very special, the staff, the room and the breakfast were of a high standard. I did my research before booking and the great reviews on this hotel helped me choose and I wasn't disappointed. The location is also great as the lovely street is very quiet at night yet you're just a short walk away from Russell Square tube and the British Museum is a two minute walk. I will be returning to London and will definitely stay in the Montague.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. It is lovely to read that you had a brilliant trip to London and that the Montague team ensured that your stay was very special.

We invest heavily in training our staff to provide first class customer care to ensure that our guests leave us feeling that they have received exceptional service. I am delighted that you were not disappointed with your stay with us. When these efforts are acknowledged it makes all our hard work worthwhile. It is wonderful to know that you will return to the Montague and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerely, Dirk Crokaert General Manager

Without doubt one of the friendliest hotels we've ever stayed in. The location is excellent close to the West End, which was the original reason we stayed here 3 years ago, close to tube stations but if you prefer to travel by taxi there was always a plentiful supply, day or night. We came back again to celebrate a 50th birthday present, no hesitation in returning to this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious, optional "turn down" service, with chocolates provided, Meal times most acceptable, Restaurant, excellent, Afternoon Tea looked very nice or if you prefer something a little les formal the same menu is on offer in the Terrace Bar. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are a credit to the hotel, would go back without any hesitation.

Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your lovely comments about your recent visit. Your kind comment that the Montague is one of the friendliest hotels you have ever stayed in is most exciting to read.

Last stayed here two years ago so on our return trip recently I had reservations - would this lovely hotel live up to expectation and memory? Well it did and some! Its so lovely to see standards not only maintained but if possible improved since we last stayed here. Right through from the doorman to reception , dining room and room service, everything was spot on! This time we booked a junior suite but were welcomed back as returning guests and upgraded to a Master Suite - fabulous. Spacious sitting room and bedroom with wonderful bathroom- quality toiletries supplied and each evening our "turn down" service left ice bucket, sliced lemon, and a tray of delicious sweets including chocolate dipped strawberries - yum:) Breakfast was tasty - something often missing in hotel food. A lovely selection of fruit, meats and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast with eggs of your choice freshly cooked to order, constant refills of tea and coffee, juice & toast. Staff were helpful, courteous and informed Brilliant three day stay here and will definitely be back again :) Keep up the excellent work everyone

I have not stayed in this hotel, but I can report that I attended a private function (an anniversary party for 50 or so guests) which was excellent in every respect. Beginning with a friendly greeting and bag taken to the cloakroom and ticket brought back, there was progress towards a small function room leading to the conservatory which in turn gave access to the beautiful lawns of the extensive garden.
