We visited The Covent Garden Hotel (Firmdale) for a 4 day stay. We regularly visit London and stay in Covent Garden but this was our first visit to this hotel......how sorry we were not to have stayed there before! Not only is it beautiful hotel, the welcome we received was so sincere. Our room was gorgeous, with everything (and more!) we could have wished for. It was for a special birthday and anniversary, which was acknowledged by the hotel with a chilled bottle of champagne in our room! So thoughtful. It was pure misfortune that my wife became extremely unwell during the stay and we were unable to experience the wonderful ambiance of the hotel. At this point, I would like to mention the staff, in reception, the restaurant and housekeeping......they couldn't have shown more concern and were so supportive, they were exemplary. We can't wait to return and enjoy the wonderful food and to say a personal 'thank you' to everyone. If you are looking for a fabulous hotel, look no further!

We stayed for around 8 nights in 2013 and enjoyed every day of them. The location was great and the breakfast amazing. Our room was big and cosy at the same time and the staff were very friendly. The location of the hotel is perfect near Covent Garden and close to Leicester Square. Would definitely stay again there!

What a great hotel in a fantastic location. The atmosphere throughout the hotel is amazing. The rooms for a hotel in London are a nice size and very comfortable, service was unsurpassed!! Great pub as well and breakfast was wonderful !

We were lucky enough to stay in the loft suite on this trip, which was spectacular...but what really makes this hotel special is the staff. The are attentive, professional and friendly - across the board from reception, the concierge, restaurant and housekeeping. So many other hotels get this wrong but CGH gets it right every time. Thoroughly recommended. Room Tip: There are no bad rooms. All very quiet. See more room tips

This was definitely a wonderful surprise. This quaint and charming hotel was staffed by people who made sure every need was catered for. I went on business to conduct interviews. The library was the perfect place for meeting people in a relaxed but professional atmosphere. This hotel will definitely be my place to stay from now on be it for business or pleasure.

Went in for lunch and a drink - welcomed by Luke who was brilliant. Told us all about the new flagship Hamyard hotel and was 100% attentive and happy to chat. We subsequently visited Hamyard and had a guided tour of the hotel which is stunning. We will still probably go back to the Covent Garden Hotel though for its unique atmosphere.

A lovely place to be in every way. From the wonderful, caring and thoughtful staff to the beautifully appointed drawing room, restaurant and common areas to the gorgeous whimsical rooms and fantastic bathrooms our stay could not have been better. This is my third visit to this wonderful property and it gets better each time. My son flipped over the scones at tea, they were truly more delicious than those served at the fancy high tea at Browns hotel! To illustrate the extra mile the staff will go to - At the Covent garden hotel - The same son was most generously treated to extra scones late in the evening by the most kind bearded waiter who originates from Spain. Luke and all the of the concierge were incredibly helpful in ensuring we had spectacular meals and great theater tickets. Must also mention that breakfast is delicious - don't forget to try the incredible house made granola and I have to comment on the array of fresh fruit that is presented at ripe perfection as it is a personal annoyance to me when a restaurant serves unripe and poor quality fruit. I love luxurious boutique hotels and The experience at the Covent garden hotel is one my absolute favorites!

This is a lovely intimate hotel in a great location that has been beautifully designed. The space is at once casual, quirky, yet classic and luxurious -- the rooms as well. That's a hard line to walk! The street is quaint and the location, as other reviewers have mentioned, is central to theaters and many other sights as well. I echo the other reviews with regard to their attached restaurant, simply mediocre food but very friendly service and incredibly convenient. The rooms were immaculate, seriously immaculate. The linens were sublime (very high thread count), pillows and beds extremely comfortable to the extent that waking was difficult.

This is a great hotel very well located , double windows quite in room, great walking distance any were or bike on a sunny day. The hotel is design hotel so all is nice but the service is just ok, mainly the reception , could use older more experienced service oriented people , they just do what you ask no extra mile, When asked about reservations at sister hotel they reply do it online. Or when asked about the bed setup they say maybe it could be changed to a twin than forget about it and don't ask again. The service at breakfast was great and so was Nicky the concierge , helpful friendly and had good restaurant tips. Would be back and stayed in two other firmdale hotels but why they don't follow or encourage that is beyond my logic. Room Tip: Stayed in 217 a large room very nice but facing Shaftesbury ave. quite as per double glass. See more room tips

The Covent Garden Hotel is located on a charming street in a âhappeningâ neighborhood. The rooms are well designed with the design details not overwhelmingly obvious. The staff is helpful. We arrived at 6:50 pm, asked the concierge for ticket recommendations and we were in our seats watching the curtain rise on âBringing up the Bodiesâ at 7:30 pm.

A lovely place to be in every way. From the wonderful, caring and thoughtful staff to the beautifully appointed drawing room, restaurant and common areas to the gorgeous whimsical rooms and fantastic bathrooms our stay could not have been better. This is my third visit to this wonderful property and it gets better each time. My son flipped over the scones at tea, they were truly more delicious than those served at the fancy high tea at Browns hotel! To illustrate the extra mile the staff will go to - At the Covent garden hotel - The same son was most generously treated to extra scones late in the evening by the most kind bearded waiter who originates from Spain. Luke and all the of the concierge were incredibly helpful in ensuring we had spectacular meals and great theater tickets. Must also mention that breakfast is delicious - don't forget to try the incredible house made granola and I have to comment on the array of fresh fruit that is presented at ripe perfection as it is a personal annoyance to me when a restaurant serves unripe and poor quality fruit. I love luxurious boutique hotels and The experience at the Covent garden hotel is one my absolute favorites!

This is a lovely intimate hotel in a great location that has been beautifully designed. The space is at once casual, quirky, yet classic and luxurious -- the rooms as well. That's a hard line to walk! The street is quaint and the location, as other reviewers have mentioned, is central to theaters and many other sights as well. I echo the other reviews with regard to their attached restaurant, simply mediocre food but very friendly service and incredibly convenient. The rooms were immaculate, seriously immaculate. The linens were sublime (very high thread count), pillows and beds extremely comfortable to the extent that waking was difficult.

This is a great hotel very well located , double windows quite in room, great walking distance any were or bike on a sunny day. The hotel is design hotel so all is nice but the service is just ok, mainly the reception , could use older more experienced service oriented people , they just do what you ask no extra mile, When asked about reservations at sister hotel they reply do it online. Or when asked about the bed setup they say maybe it could be changed to a twin than forget about it and don't ask again. The service at breakfast was great and so was Nicky the concierge , helpful friendly and had good restaurant tips. Would be back and stayed in two other firmdale hotels but why they don't follow or encourage that is beyond my logic. Room Tip: Stayed in 217 a large room very nice but facing Shaftesbury ave. quite as per double glass. See more room tips

The Covent Garden Hotel is located on a charming street in a âhappeningâ neighborhood. The rooms are well designed with the design details not overwhelmingly obvious. The staff is helpful. We arrived at 6:50 pm, asked the concierge for ticket recommendations and we were in our seats watching the curtain rise on âBringing up the Bodiesâ at 7:30 pm.

We visited The Covent Garden Hotel (Firmdale) for a 4 day stay. We regularly visit London and stay in Covent Garden but this was our first visit to this hotel......how sorry we were not to have stayed there before! Not only is it beautiful hotel, the welcome we received was so sincere. Our room was gorgeous, with everything (and more!) we could have wished for. It was for a special birthday and anniversary, which was acknowledged by the hotel with a chilled bottle of champagne in our room! So thoughtful. It was pure misfortune that my wife became extremely unwell during the stay and we were unable to experience the wonderful ambiance of the hotel. At this point, I would like to mention the staff, in reception, the restaurant and housekeeping......they couldn't have shown more concern and were so supportive, they were exemplary. We can't wait to return and enjoy the wonderful food and to say a personal 'thank you' to everyone. If you are looking for a fabulous hotel, look no further!

We stayed for around 8 nights in 2013 and enjoyed every day of them. The location was great and the breakfast amazing. Our room was big and cosy at the same time and the staff were very friendly. The location of the hotel is perfect near Covent Garden and close to Leicester Square. Would definitely stay again there!

What a great hotel in a fantastic location. The atmosphere throughout the hotel is amazing. The rooms for a hotel in London are a nice size and very comfortable, service was unsurpassed!! Great pub as well and breakfast was wonderful !

We were lucky enough to stay in the loft suite on this trip, which was spectacular...but what really makes this hotel special is the staff. The are attentive, professional and friendly - across the board from reception, the concierge, restaurant and housekeeping. So many other hotels get this wrong but CGH gets it right every time. Thoroughly recommended. Room Tip: There are no bad rooms. All very quiet. See more room tips

This was definitely a wonderful surprise. This quaint and charming hotel was staffed by people who made sure every need was catered for. I went on business to conduct interviews. The library was the perfect place for meeting people in a relaxed but professional atmosphere. This hotel will definitely be my place to stay from now on be it for business or pleasure.

The service at breakfast was great and so was Nicky the concierge , helpful friendly and had good restaurant tips. Would be back and stayed in two other firmdale hotels but why they don't follow or encourage that is beyond my logic. Room Tip: Stayed in 217 a large room very nice but facing Shaftesbury ave. quite as per double glass. See more room tips

The Covent Garden Hotel is located on a charming street in a âhappeningâ neighborhood. The rooms are well designed with the design details not overwhelmingly obvious. The staff is helpful. We arrived at 6:50 pm, asked the concierge for ticket recommendations and we were in our seats watching the curtain rise on âBringing up the Bodiesâ at 7:30 pm.

We visited The Covent Garden Hotel (Firmdale) for a 4 day stay. We regularly visit London and stay in Covent Garden but this was our first visit to this hotel......how sorry we were not to have stayed there before! Not only is it beautiful hotel, the welcome we received was so sincere. Our room was gorgeous, with everything (and more!) we could have wished for. It was for a special birthday and anniversary, which was acknowledged by the hotel with a chilled bottle of champagne in our room! So thoughtful. It was pure misfortune that my wife became extremely unwell during the stay and we were unable to experience the wonderful ambiance of the hotel. At this point, I would like to mention the staff, in reception, the restaurant and housekeeping......they couldn't have shown more concern and were so supportive, they were exemplary. We can't wait to return and enjoy the wonderful food and to say a personal 'thank you' to everyone. If you are looking for a fabulous hotel, look no further!

We stayed for around 8 nights in 2013 and enjoyed every day of them. The location was great and the breakfast amazing. Our room was big and cosy at the same time and the staff were very friendly. The location of the hotel is perfect near Covent Garden and close to Leicester Square. Would definitely stay again there!

What a great hotel in a fantastic location. The atmosphere throughout the hotel is amazing. The rooms for a hotel in London are a nice size and very comfortable, service was unsurpassed!! Great pub as well and breakfast was wonderful !

We were lucky enough to stay in the loft suite on this trip, which was spectacular...but what really makes this hotel special is the staff. The are attentive, professional and friendly - across the board from reception, the concierge, restaurant and housekeeping. So many other hotels get this wrong but CGH gets it right every time. Thoroughly recommended. Room Tip: There are no bad rooms. All very quiet. See more room tips

This was definitely a wonderful surprise. This quaint and charming hotel was staffed by people who made sure every need was catered for. I went on business to conduct interviews. The library was the perfect place for meeting people in a relaxed but professional atmosphere. This hotel will definitely be my place to stay from now on be it for business or pleasure.

Went in for lunch and a drink - welcomed by Luke who was brilliant. Told us all about the new flagship Hamyard hotel and was 100% attentive and happy to chat. We subsequently visited Hamyard and had a guided tour of the hotel which is stunning. We will still probably go back to the Covent Garden Hotel though for its unique atmosphere.

A lovely place to be in every way. From the wonderful, caring and thoughtful staff to the beautifully appointed drawing room, restaurant and common areas to the gorgeous whimsical rooms and fantastic bathrooms our stay could not have been better. This is my third visit to this wonderful property and it gets better each time. My son flipped over the scones at tea, they were truly more delicious than those served at the fancy high tea at Browns hotel! To illustrate the extra mile the staff will go to - At the Covent garden hotel - The same son was most generously treated to extra scones late in the evening by the most kind bearded waiter who originates from Spain. Luke and all the of the concierge were incredibly helpful in ensuring we had spectacular meals and great theater tickets. Must also mention that breakfast is delicious - don't forget to try the incredible house made granola and I have to comment on the array of fresh fruit that is presented at ripe perfection as it is a personal annoyance to me when a restaurant serves unripe and poor quality fruit. I love luxurious boutique hotels and The experience at the Covent garden hotel is one my absolute favorites!

This is a lovely intimate hotel in a great location that has been beautifully designed. The space is at once casual, quirky, yet classic and luxurious -- the rooms as well. That's a hard line to walk! The street is quaint and the location, as other reviewers have mentioned, is central to theaters and many other sights as well. I echo the other reviews with regard to their attached restaurant, simply mediocre food but very friendly service and incredibly convenient. The rooms were immaculate, seriously immaculate. The linens were sublime (very high thread count), pillows and beds extremely comfortable to the extent that waking was difficult.

What a great hotel in a fantastic location. The atmosphere throughout the hotel is amazing. The rooms for a hotel in London are a nice size and very comfortable, service was unsurpassed!! Great pub as well and breakfast was wonderful !

We were lucky enough to stay in the loft suite on this trip, which was spectacular...but what really makes this hotel special is the staff. The are attentive, professional and friendly - across the board from reception, the concierge, restaurant and housekeeping. So many other hotels get this wrong but CGH gets it right every time. Thoroughly recommended. Room Tip: There are no bad rooms. All very quiet. See more room tips

This was definitely a wonderful surprise. This quaint and charming hotel was staffed by people who made sure every need was catered for. I went on business to conduct interviews. The library was the perfect place for meeting people in a relaxed but professional atmosphere. This hotel will definitely be my place to stay from now on be it for business or pleasure.

Went in for lunch and a drink - welcomed by Luke who was brilliant. Told us all about the new flagship Hamyard hotel and was 100% attentive and happy to chat. We subsequently visited Hamyard and had a guided tour of the hotel which is stunning. We will still probably go back to the Covent Garden Hotel though for its unique atmosphere.

A lovely place to be in every way. From the wonderful, caring and thoughtful staff to the beautifully appointed drawing room, restaurant and common areas to the gorgeous whimsical rooms and fantastic bathrooms our stay could not have been better. This is my third visit to this wonderful property and it gets better each time. My son flipped over the scones at tea, they were truly more delicious than those served at the fancy high tea at Browns hotel! To illustrate the extra mile the staff will go to - At the Covent garden hotel - The same son was most generously treated to extra scones late in the evening by the most kind bearded waiter who originates from Spain. Luke and all the of the concierge were incredibly helpful in ensuring we had spectacular meals and great theater tickets. Must also mention that breakfast is delicious - don't forget to try the incredible house made granola and I have to comment on the array of fresh fruit that is presented at ripe perfection as it is a personal annoyance to me when a restaurant serves unripe and poor quality fruit. I love luxurious boutique hotels and The experience at the Covent garden hotel is one my absolute favorites!

This is a lovely intimate hotel in a great location that has been beautifully designed. The space is at once casual, quirky, yet classic and luxurious -- the rooms as well. That's a hard line to walk! The street is quaint and the location, as other reviewers have mentioned, is central to theaters and many other sights as well. I echo the other reviews with regard to their attached restaurant, simply mediocre food but very friendly service and incredibly convenient. The rooms were immaculate, seriously immaculate. The linens were sublime (very high thread count), pillows and beds extremely comfortable to the extent that waking was difficult.

This is a great hotel very well located , double windows quite in room, great walking distance any were or bike on a sunny day. The hotel is design hotel so all is nice but the service is just ok, mainly the reception , could use older more experienced service oriented people , they just do what you ask no extra mile, When asked about reservations at sister hotel they reply do it online. Or when asked about the bed setup they say maybe it could be changed to a twin than forget about it and don't ask again. The service at breakfast was great and so was Nicky the concierge , helpful friendly and had good restaurant tips. Would be back and stayed in two other firmdale hotels but why they don't follow or encourage that is beyond my logic. Room Tip: Stayed in 217 a large room very nice but facing Shaftesbury ave. quite as per double glass. See more room tips

The Covent Garden Hotel is located on a charming street in a âhappeningâ neighborhood. The rooms are well designed with the design details not overwhelmingly obvious. The staff is helpful. We arrived at 6:50 pm, asked the concierge for ticket recommendations and we were in our seats watching the curtain rise on âBringing up the Bodiesâ at 7:30 pm.

We visited The Covent Garden Hotel (Firmdale) for a 4 day stay. We regularly visit London and stay in Covent Garden but this was our first visit to this hotel......how sorry we were not to have stayed there before! Not only is it beautiful hotel, the welcome we received was so sincere. Our room was gorgeous, with everything (and more!) we could have wished for. It was for a special birthday and anniversary, which was acknowledged by the hotel with a chilled bottle of champagne in our room! So thoughtful. It was pure misfortune that my wife became extremely unwell during the stay and we were unable to experience the wonderful ambiance of the hotel. At this point, I would like to mention the staff, in reception, the restaurant and housekeeping......they couldn't have shown more concern and were so supportive, they were exemplary. We can't wait to return and enjoy the wonderful food and to say a personal 'thank you' to everyone. If you are looking for a fabulous hotel, look no further!

I love luxurious boutique hotels and The experience at the Covent garden hotel is one my absolute favorites!

This is a lovely intimate hotel in a great location that has been beautifully designed. The space is at once casual, quirky, yet classic and luxurious -- the rooms as well. That's a hard line to walk! The street is quaint and the location, as other reviewers have mentioned, is central to theaters and many other sights as well. I echo the other reviews with regard to their attached restaurant, simply mediocre food but very friendly service and incredibly convenient. The rooms were immaculate, seriously immaculate. The linens were sublime (very high thread count), pillows and beds extremely comfortable to the extent that waking was difficult.

This is a great hotel very well located , double windows quite in room, great walking distance any were or bike on a sunny day. The hotel is design hotel so all is nice but the service is just ok, mainly the reception , could use older more experienced service oriented people , they just do what you ask no extra mile, When asked about reservations at sister hotel they reply do it online. Or when asked about the bed setup they say maybe it could be changed to a twin than forget about it and don't ask again. The service at breakfast was great and so was Nicky the concierge , helpful friendly and had good restaurant tips. Would be back and stayed in two other firmdale hotels but why they don't follow or encourage that is beyond my logic. Room Tip: Stayed in 217 a large room very nice but facing Shaftesbury ave. quite as per double glass. See more room tips

The Covent Garden Hotel is located on a charming street in a âhappeningâ neighborhood. The rooms are well designed with the design details not overwhelmingly obvious. The staff is helpful. We arrived at 6:50 pm, asked the concierge for ticket recommendations and we were in our seats watching the curtain rise on âBringing up the Bodiesâ at 7:30 pm.

We visited The Covent Garden Hotel (Firmdale) for a 4 day stay. We regularly visit London and stay in Covent Garden but this was our first visit to this hotel......how sorry we were not to have stayed there before! Not only is it beautiful hotel, the welcome we received was so sincere. Our room was gorgeous, with everything (and more!) we could have wished for. It was for a special birthday and anniversary, which was acknowledged by the hotel with a chilled bottle of champagne in our room! So thoughtful. It was pure misfortune that my wife became extremely unwell during the stay and we were unable to experience the wonderful ambiance of the hotel. At this point, I would like to mention the staff, in reception, the restaurant and housekeeping......they couldn't have shown more concern and were so supportive, they were exemplary. We can't wait to return and enjoy the wonderful food and to say a personal 'thank you' to everyone. If you are looking for a fabulous hotel, look no further!

We stayed for around 8 nights in 2013 and enjoyed every day of them. The location was great and the breakfast amazing. Our room was big and cosy at the same time and the staff were very friendly. The location of the hotel is perfect near Covent Garden and close to Leicester Square. Would definitely stay again there!

What a great hotel in a fantastic location. The atmosphere throughout the hotel is amazing. The rooms for a hotel in London are a nice size and very comfortable, service was unsurpassed!! Great pub as well and breakfast was wonderful !

We were lucky enough to stay in the loft suite on this trip, which was spectacular...but what really makes this hotel special is the staff. The are attentive, professional and friendly - across the board from reception, the concierge, restaurant and housekeeping. So many other hotels get this wrong but CGH gets it right every time. Thoroughly recommended. Room Tip: There are no bad rooms. All very quiet. See more room tips

This was definitely a wonderful surprise. This quaint and charming hotel was staffed by people who made sure every need was catered for. I went on business to conduct interviews. The library was the perfect place for meeting people in a relaxed but professional atmosphere. This hotel will definitely be my place to stay from now on be it for business or pleasure.

Went in for lunch and a drink - welcomed by Luke who was brilliant. Told us all about the new flagship Hamyard hotel and was 100% attentive and happy to chat. We subsequently visited Hamyard and had a guided tour of the hotel which is stunning. We will still probably go back to the Covent Garden Hotel though for its unique atmosphere.

A lovely place to be in every way. From the wonderful, caring and thoughtful staff to the beautifully appointed drawing room, restaurant and common areas to the gorgeous whimsical rooms and fantastic bathrooms our stay could not have been better. This is my third visit to this wonderful property and it gets better each time. My son flipped over the scones at tea, they were truly more delicious than those served at the fancy high tea at Browns hotel! To illustrate the extra mile the staff will go to - At the Covent garden hotel - The same son was most generously treated to extra scones late in the evening by the most kind bearded waiter who originates from Spain.

We regularly visit London and stay in Covent Garden but this was our first visit to this hotel......how sorry we were not to have stayed there before! Not only is it beautiful hotel, the welcome we received was so sincere. Our room was gorgeous, with everything (and more!) we could have wished for. It was for a special birthday and anniversary, which was acknowledged by the hotel with a chilled bottle of champagne in our room! So thoughtful. It was pure misfortune that my wife became extremely unwell during the stay and we were unable to experience the wonderful ambiance of the hotel. At this point, I would like to mention the staff, in reception, the restaurant and housekeeping......they couldn't have shown more concern and were so supportive, they were exemplary. We can't wait to return and enjoy the wonderful food and to say a personal 'thank you' to everyone. If you are looking for a fabulous hotel, look no further!

We stayed for around 8 nights in 2013 and enjoyed every day of them. The location was great and the breakfast amazing. Our room was big and cosy at the same time and the staff were very friendly. The location of the hotel is perfect near Covent Garden and close to Leicester Square. Would definitely stay again there!

What a great hotel in a fantastic location. The atmosphere throughout the hotel is amazing. The rooms for a hotel in London are a nice size and very comfortable, service was unsurpassed!! Great pub as well and breakfast was wonderful !

We were lucky enough to stay in the loft suite on this trip, which was spectacular...but what really makes this hotel special is the staff. The are attentive, professional and friendly - across the board from reception, the concierge, restaurant and housekeeping. So many other hotels get this wrong but CGH gets it right every time. Thoroughly recommended. Room Tip: There are no bad rooms. All very quiet. See more room tips

This was definitely a wonderful surprise. This quaint and charming hotel was staffed by people who made sure every need was catered for. I went on business to conduct interviews. The library was the perfect place for meeting people in a relaxed but professional atmosphere. This hotel will definitely be my place to stay from now on be it for business or pleasure.

Went in for lunch and a drink - welcomed by Luke who was brilliant. Told us all about the new flagship Hamyard hotel and was 100% attentive and happy to chat. We subsequently visited Hamyard and had a guided tour of the hotel which is stunning. We will still probably go back to the Covent Garden Hotel though for its unique atmosphere.

A lovely place to be in every way. From the wonderful, caring and thoughtful staff to the beautifully appointed drawing room, restaurant and common areas to the gorgeous whimsical rooms and fantastic bathrooms our stay could not have been better. This is my third visit to this wonderful property and it gets better each time. My son flipped over the scones at tea, they were truly more delicious than those served at the fancy high tea at Browns hotel! To illustrate the extra mile the staff will go to - At the Covent garden hotel - The same son was most generously treated to extra scones late in the evening by the most kind bearded waiter who originates from Spain. Luke and all the of the concierge were incredibly helpful in ensuring we had spectacular meals and great theater tickets. Must also mention that breakfast is delicious - don't forget to try the incredible house made granola and I have to comment on the array of fresh fruit that is presented at ripe perfection as it is a personal annoyance to me when a restaurant serves unripe and poor quality fruit. I love luxurious boutique hotels and The experience at the Covent garden hotel is one my absolute favorites!

This is a lovely intimate hotel in a great location that has been beautifully designed. The space is at once casual, quirky, yet classic and luxurious -- the rooms as well. That's a hard line to walk! The street is quaint and the location, as other reviewers have mentioned, is central to theaters and many other sights as well. I echo the other reviews with regard to their attached restaurant, simply mediocre food but very friendly service and incredibly convenient. The rooms were immaculate, seriously immaculate. The linens were sublime (very high thread count), pillows and beds extremely comfortable to the extent that waking was difficult.

This is a great hotel very well located , double windows quite in room, great walking distance any were or bike on a sunny day. The hotel is design hotel so all is nice but the service is just ok, mainly the reception , could use older more experienced service oriented people , they just do what you ask no extra mile, When asked about reservations at sister hotel they reply do it online. Or when asked about the bed setup they say maybe it could be changed to a twin than forget about it and don't ask again. The service at breakfast was great and so was Nicky the concierge , helpful friendly and had good restaurant tips. Would be back and stayed in two other firmdale hotels but why they don't follow or encourage that is beyond my logic. Room Tip: Stayed in 217 a large room very nice but facing Shaftesbury ave. quite as per double glass. See more room tips

The Covent Garden Hotel is located on a charming street in a âhappeningâ neighborhood. The rooms are well designed with the design details not overwhelmingly obvious. The staff is helpful.

Went in for lunch and a drink - welcomed by Luke who was brilliant. Told us all about the new flagship Hamyard hotel and was 100% attentive and happy to chat. We subsequently visited Hamyard and had a guided tour of the hotel which is stunning. We will still probably go back to the Covent Garden Hotel though for its unique atmosphere.

A lovely place to be in every way. From the wonderful, caring and thoughtful staff to the beautifully appointed drawing room, restaurant and common areas to the gorgeous whimsical rooms and fantastic bathrooms our stay could not have been better. This is my third visit to this wonderful property and it gets better each time. My son flipped over the scones at tea, they were truly more delicious than those served at the fancy high tea at Browns hotel! To illustrate the extra mile the staff will go to - At the Covent garden hotel - The same son was most generously treated to extra scones late in the evening by the most kind bearded waiter who originates from Spain. Luke and all the of the concierge were incredibly helpful in ensuring we had spectacular meals and great theater tickets. Must also mention that breakfast is delicious - don't forget to try the incredible house made granola and I have to comment on the array of fresh fruit that is presented at ripe perfection as it is a personal annoyance to me when a restaurant serves unripe and poor quality fruit. I love luxurious boutique hotels and The experience at the Covent garden hotel is one my absolute favorites!

This is a lovely intimate hotel in a great location that has been beautifully designed. The space is at once casual, quirky, yet classic and luxurious -- the rooms as well. That's a hard line to walk! The street is quaint and the location, as other reviewers have mentioned, is central to theaters and many other sights as well. I echo the other reviews with regard to their attached restaurant, simply mediocre food but very friendly service and incredibly convenient. The rooms were immaculate, seriously immaculate. The linens were sublime (very high thread count), pillows and beds extremely comfortable to the extent that waking was difficult.

This is a great hotel very well located , double windows quite in room, great walking distance any were or bike on a sunny day. The hotel is design hotel so all is nice but the service is just ok, mainly the reception , could use older more experienced service oriented people , they just do what you ask no extra mile, When asked about reservations at sister hotel they reply do it online. Or when asked about the bed setup they say maybe it could be changed to a twin than forget about it and don't ask again. The service at breakfast was great and so was Nicky the concierge , helpful friendly and had good restaurant tips. Would be back and stayed in two other firmdale hotels but why they don't follow or encourage that is beyond my logic. Room Tip: Stayed in 217 a large room very nice but facing Shaftesbury ave. quite as per double glass. See more room tips

The Covent Garden Hotel is located on a charming street in a âhappeningâ neighborhood. The rooms are well designed with the design details not overwhelmingly obvious. The staff is helpful. We arrived at 6:50 pm, asked the concierge for ticket recommendations and we were in our seats watching the curtain rise on âBringing up the Bodiesâ at 7:30 pm.

We visited The Covent Garden Hotel (Firmdale) for a 4 day stay. We regularly visit London and stay in Covent Garden but this was our first visit to this hotel......how sorry we were not to have stayed there before! Not only is it beautiful hotel, the welcome we received was so sincere. Our room was gorgeous, with everything (and more!) we could have wished for. It was for a special birthday and anniversary, which was acknowledged by the hotel with a chilled bottle of champagne in our room! So thoughtful. It was pure misfortune that my wife became extremely unwell during the stay and we were unable to experience the wonderful ambiance of the hotel. At this point, I would like to mention the staff, in reception, the restaurant and housekeeping......they couldn't have shown more concern and were so supportive, they were exemplary. We can't wait to return and enjoy the wonderful food and to say a personal 'thank you' to everyone. If you are looking for a fabulous hotel, look no further!

We stayed for around 8 nights in 2013 and enjoyed every day of them. The location was great and the breakfast amazing. Our room was big and cosy at the same time and the staff were very friendly. The location of the hotel is perfect near Covent Garden and close to Leicester Square. Would definitely stay again there!

What a great hotel in a fantastic location. The atmosphere throughout the hotel is amazing. The rooms for a hotel in London are a nice size and very comfortable, service was unsurpassed!! Great pub as well and breakfast was wonderful !

We were lucky enough to stay in the loft suite on this trip, which was spectacular...but what really makes this hotel special is the staff. The are attentive, professional and friendly - across the board from reception, the concierge, restaurant and housekeeping. So many other hotels get this wrong but CGH gets it right every time. Thoroughly recommended. Room Tip: There are no bad rooms. All very quiet. See more room tips

The hotel is design hotel so all is nice but the service is just ok, mainly the reception , could use older more experienced service oriented people , they just do what you ask no extra mile, When asked about reservations at sister hotel they reply do it online. Or when asked about the bed setup they say maybe it could be changed to a twin than forget about it and don't ask again. The service at breakfast was great and so was Nicky the concierge , helpful friendly and had good restaurant tips. Would be back and stayed in two other firmdale hotels but why they don't follow or encourage that is beyond my logic. Room Tip: Stayed in 217 a large room very nice but facing Shaftesbury ave. quite as per double glass. See more room tips

The Covent Garden Hotel is located on a charming street in a âhappeningâ neighborhood. The rooms are well designed with the design details not overwhelmingly obvious. The staff is helpful. We arrived at 6:50 pm, asked the concierge for ticket recommendations and we were in our seats watching the curtain rise on âBringing up the Bodiesâ at 7:30 pm.

We visited The Covent Garden Hotel (Firmdale) for a 4 day stay. We regularly visit London and stay in Covent Garden but this was our first visit to this hotel......how sorry we were not to have stayed there before! Not only is it beautiful hotel, the welcome we received was so sincere. Our room was gorgeous, with everything (and more!) we could have wished for. It was for a special birthday and anniversary, which was acknowledged by the hotel with a chilled bottle of champagne in our room! So thoughtful. It was pure misfortune that my wife became extremely unwell during the stay and we were unable to experience the wonderful ambiance of the hotel. At this point, I would like to mention the staff, in reception, the restaurant and housekeeping......they couldn't have shown more concern and were so supportive, they were exemplary. We can't wait to return and enjoy the wonderful food and to say a personal 'thank you' to everyone. If you are looking for a fabulous hotel, look no further!

We stayed for around 8 nights in 2013 and enjoyed every day of them. The location was great and the breakfast amazing. Our room was big and cosy at the same time and the staff were very friendly. The location of the hotel is perfect near Covent Garden and close to Leicester Square. Would definitely stay again there!

What a great hotel in a fantastic location. The atmosphere throughout the hotel is amazing. The rooms for a hotel in London are a nice size and very comfortable, service was unsurpassed!! Great pub as well and breakfast was wonderful !

We were lucky enough to stay in the loft suite on this trip, which was spectacular...but what really makes this hotel special is the staff. The are attentive, professional and friendly - across the board from reception, the concierge, restaurant and housekeeping. So many other hotels get this wrong but CGH gets it right every time. Thoroughly recommended. Room Tip: There are no bad rooms. All very quiet. See more room tips

This was definitely a wonderful surprise. This quaint and charming hotel was staffed by people who made sure every need was catered for. I went on business to conduct interviews. The library was the perfect place for meeting people in a relaxed but professional atmosphere. This hotel will definitely be my place to stay from now on be it for business or pleasure.

Went in for lunch and a drink - welcomed by Luke who was brilliant. Told us all about the new flagship Hamyard hotel and was 100% attentive and happy to chat. We subsequently visited Hamyard and had a guided tour of the hotel which is stunning. We will still probably go back to the Covent Garden Hotel though for its unique atmosphere.

A lovely place to be in every way. From the wonderful, caring and thoughtful staff to the beautifully appointed drawing room, restaurant and common areas to the gorgeous whimsical rooms and fantastic bathrooms our stay could not have been better. This is my third visit to this wonderful property and it gets better each time. My son flipped over the scones at tea, they were truly more delicious than those served at the fancy high tea at Browns hotel! To illustrate the extra mile the staff will go to - At the Covent garden hotel - The same son was most generously treated to extra scones late in the evening by the most kind bearded waiter who originates from Spain. Luke and all the of the concierge were incredibly helpful in ensuring we had spectacular meals and great theater tickets. Must also mention that breakfast is delicious - don't forget to try the incredible house made granola and I have to comment on the array of fresh fruit that is presented at ripe perfection as it is a personal annoyance to me when a restaurant serves unripe and poor quality fruit. I love luxurious boutique hotels and The experience at the Covent garden hotel is one my absolute favorites!

This is a lovely intimate hotel in a great location that has been beautifully designed. The space is at once casual, quirky, yet classic and luxurious -- the rooms as well. That's a hard line to walk! The street is quaint and the location, as other reviewers have mentioned, is central to theaters and many other sights as well. I echo the other reviews with regard to their attached restaurant, simply mediocre food but very friendly service and incredibly convenient. The rooms were immaculate, seriously immaculate. The linens were sublime (very high thread count), pillows and beds extremely comfortable to the extent that waking was difficult.

The location of the hotel is perfect near Covent Garden and close to Leicester Square. Would definitely stay again there!

What a great hotel in a fantastic location. The atmosphere throughout the hotel is amazing. The rooms for a hotel in London are a nice size and very comfortable, service was unsurpassed!! Great pub as well and breakfast was wonderful !

We were lucky enough to stay in the loft suite on this trip, which was spectacular...but what really makes this hotel special is the staff. The are attentive, professional and friendly - across the board from reception, the concierge, restaurant and housekeeping. So many other hotels get this wrong but CGH gets it right every time. Thoroughly recommended. Room Tip: There are no bad rooms. All very quiet. See more room tips

This was definitely a wonderful surprise. This quaint and charming hotel was staffed by people who made sure every need was catered for. I went on business to conduct interviews. The library was the perfect place for meeting people in a relaxed but professional atmosphere. This hotel will definitely be my place to stay from now on be it for business or pleasure.

Went in for lunch and a drink - welcomed by Luke who was brilliant. Told us all about the new flagship Hamyard hotel and was 100% attentive and happy to chat. We subsequently visited Hamyard and had a guided tour of the hotel which is stunning. We will still probably go back to the Covent Garden Hotel though for its unique atmosphere.

A lovely place to be in every way. From the wonderful, caring and thoughtful staff to the beautifully appointed drawing room, restaurant and common areas to the gorgeous whimsical rooms and fantastic bathrooms our stay could not have been better. This is my third visit to this wonderful property and it gets better each time. My son flipped over the scones at tea, they were truly more delicious than those served at the fancy high tea at Browns hotel! To illustrate the extra mile the staff will go to - At the Covent garden hotel - The same son was most generously treated to extra scones late in the evening by the most kind bearded waiter who originates from Spain. Luke and all the of the concierge were incredibly helpful in ensuring we had spectacular meals and great theater tickets. Must also mention that breakfast is delicious - don't forget to try the incredible house made granola and I have to comment on the array of fresh fruit that is presented at ripe perfection as it is a personal annoyance to me when a restaurant serves unripe and poor quality fruit. I love luxurious boutique hotels and The experience at the Covent garden hotel is one my absolute favorites!

This is a lovely intimate hotel in a great location that has been beautifully designed. The space is at once casual, quirky, yet classic and luxurious -- the rooms as well. That's a hard line to walk! The street is quaint and the location, as other reviewers have mentioned, is central to theaters and many other sights as well. I echo the other reviews with regard to their attached restaurant, simply mediocre food but very friendly service and incredibly convenient. The rooms were immaculate, seriously immaculate. The linens were sublime (very high thread count), pillows and beds extremely comfortable to the extent that waking was difficult. Room Tip: Rooms on the first floor have more convenient access to the library and honor bar; two wonderful com... See more room tips

This is a great hotel very well located , double windows quite in room, great walking distance any were or bike on a sunny day. The hotel is design hotel so all is nice but the service is just ok, mainly the reception , could use older more experienced service oriented people , they just do what you ask no extra mile, When asked about reservations at sister hotel they reply do it online. Or when asked about the bed setup they say maybe it could be changed to a twin than forget about it and don't ask again. The service at breakfast was great and so was Nicky the concierge , helpful friendly and had good restaurant tips. Would be back and stayed in two other firmdale hotels but why they don't follow or encourage that is beyond my logic. Room Tip: Stayed in 217 a large room very nice but facing Shaftesbury ave. quite as per double glass. See more room tips

The Covent Garden Hotel is located on a charming street in a âhappeningâ neighborhood. The rooms are well designed with the design details not overwhelmingly obvious. The staff is helpful. We arrived at 6:50 pm, asked the concierge for ticket recommendations and we were in our seats watching the curtain rise on âBringing up the Bodiesâ at 7:30 pm.

We visited The Covent Garden Hotel (Firmdale) for a 4 day stay. We regularly visit London and stay in Covent Garden but this was our first visit to this hotel......how sorry we were not to have stayed there before! Not only is it beautiful hotel, the welcome we received was so sincere. Our room was gorgeous, with everything (and more!) we could have wished for. It was for a special birthday and anniversary, which was acknowledged by the hotel with a chilled bottle of champagne in our room! So thoughtful. It was pure misfortune that my wife became extremely unwell during the stay and we were unable to experience the wonderful ambiance of the hotel. At this point, I would like to mention the staff, in reception, the restaurant and housekeeping......they couldn't have shown more concern and were so supportive, they were exemplary. We can't wait to return and enjoy the wonderful food and to say a personal 'thank you' to everyone. If you are looking for a fabulous hotel, look no further!
