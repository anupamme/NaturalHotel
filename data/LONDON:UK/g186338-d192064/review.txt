My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. I am delighted to hear that your mother had another enjoyable stay with us; we love to welcome back members of our Chesterfield family.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only!

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be.

I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted.

The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays.

That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback of your stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

As always, I look forward to welcoming you back to The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. Kind regards, Oliver Oliver Raggett General Manager

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people.

Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work.

On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

Last week-end (August 22nd to 25th) we stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair, our third stay since 2009. The suite we had was very luxurious and met all our expectations.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. I am delighted to hear that your mother had another enjoyable stay with us; we love to welcome back members of our Chesterfield family.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals.

Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only!

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have.

Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work.

Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection.

Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be.

The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï).

On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback of your stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. I am delighted to learn that after staying at some of our sister properties you chose to join us as The Chesterfield Mayfair to celebrate your grandmotherâs birthday. We enjoy making our guests feel at home with us and I am thrilled that you felt warmly welcomed to the hotel and that you appreciated the larger room for the special occasion. It gives me great pleasure to know that you joined us in Bulters Restaurant for lunch and that you found the food to be delicious. We take great pride in our attention to detail here at The Chesterfield and I am glad that you appreciated the added touches of birthday treats for your grandmother. Thank you for your kind words regarding the friendly and helpful service that you experienced through out your stay, I will be sure to share your review with all of my team here. As always, I look forward to welcoming you back to The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. Kind regards, Oliver Oliver Raggett General Manager

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have.

Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn.

I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time.

That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. I am delighted to hear that your mother had another enjoyable stay with us; we love to welcome back members of our Chesterfield family.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub.

Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be.

I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution.

The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation.

That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom. The location was perfect literally a minute walk to Berkley Square. The service from all staff was excellent and the English breakfast we had each morning fresh and delicious. We will be back.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback of your stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

It gives me great pleasure to know that you joined us in Bulters Restaurant for lunch and that you found the food to be delicious. We take great pride in our attention to detail here at The Chesterfield and I am glad that you appreciated the added touches of birthday treats for your grandmother. Thank you for your kind words regarding the friendly and helpful service that you experienced through out your stay, I will be sure to share your review with all of my team here. As always, I look forward to welcoming you back to The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. Kind regards, Oliver Oliver Raggett General Manager

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people.

Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work.

That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

Last week-end (August 22nd to 25th) we stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair, our third stay since 2009. The suite we had was very luxurious and met all our expectations.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. I am delighted to hear that your mother had another enjoyable stay with us; we love to welcome back members of our Chesterfield family.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel.

Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering.

That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit.

She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus.

If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection.

After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM.

We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï).

On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback of your stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. I am delighted to learn that after staying at some of our sister properties you chose to join us as The Chesterfield Mayfair to celebrate your grandmotherâs birthday. We enjoy making our guests feel at home with us and I am thrilled that you felt warmly welcomed to the hotel and that you appreciated the larger room for the special occasion. It gives me great pleasure to know that you joined us in Bulters Restaurant for lunch and that you found the food to be delicious. We take great pride in our attention to detail here at The Chesterfield and I am glad that you appreciated the added touches of birthday treats for your grandmother. Thank you for your kind words regarding the friendly and helpful service that you experienced through out your stay, I will be sure to share your review with all of my team here. As always, I look forward to welcoming you back to The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. Kind regards, Oliver Oliver Raggett General Manager

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch.

Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work.

All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

Last week-end (August 22nd to 25th) we stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair, our third stay since 2009. The suite we had was very luxurious and met all our expectations. Our long week-end in the heart of London was a great success. We always enjoy staying at The Chesterfield Mayfair and highly recommend it.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. I am delighted to hear that your mother had another enjoyable stay with us; we love to welcome back members of our Chesterfield family. I am thrilled that she appreciated the fruit and personal note in her room and that my team recognised her by name; we love when guests notice our dedication.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely.

Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only!

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process.

The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution.

The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays.

That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom. The location was perfect literally a minute walk to Berkley Square. The service from all staff was excellent and the English breakfast we had each morning fresh and delicious. We will be back.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

It gives me great pleasure to know that you joined us in Bulters Restaurant for lunch and that you found the food to be delicious. We take great pride in our attention to detail here at The Chesterfield and I am glad that you appreciated the added touches of birthday treats for your grandmother. Thank you for your kind words regarding the friendly and helpful service that you experienced through out your stay, I will be sure to share your review with all of my team here. As always, I look forward to welcoming you back to The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. Kind regards, Oliver Oliver Raggett General Manager

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have.

Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM.

All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

Last week-end (August 22nd to 25th) we stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair, our third stay since 2009. The suite we had was very luxurious and met all our expectations.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. I am delighted to hear that your mother had another enjoyable stay with us; we love to welcome back members of our Chesterfield family.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world.

I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious.

That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection.

Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM.

We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï).

On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

I am delighted to learn that after staying at some of our sister properties you chose to join us as The Chesterfield Mayfair to celebrate your grandmotherâs birthday. We enjoy making our guests feel at home with us and I am thrilled that you felt warmly welcomed to the hotel and that you appreciated the larger room for the special occasion. It gives me great pleasure to know that you joined us in Bulters Restaurant for lunch and that you found the food to be delicious. We take great pride in our attention to detail here at The Chesterfield and I am glad that you appreciated the added touches of birthday treats for your grandmother. Thank you for your kind words regarding the friendly and helpful service that you experienced through out your stay, I will be sure to share your review with all of my team here. As always, I look forward to welcoming you back to The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. Kind regards, Oliver Oliver Raggett General Manager

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus.

If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people.

Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work.

All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

Last week-end (August 22nd to 25th) we stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair, our third stay since 2009. The suite we had was very luxurious and met all our expectations. Our long week-end in the heart of London was a great success. We always enjoy staying at The Chesterfield Mayfair and highly recommend it.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. I am delighted to hear that your mother had another enjoyable stay with us; we love to welcome back members of our Chesterfield family. I am thrilled that she appreciated the fruit and personal note in her room and that my team recognised her by name; we love when guests notice our dedication.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only!

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be.

The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution.

The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays.

That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom. The location was perfect literally a minute walk to Berkley Square. The service from all staff was excellent and the English breakfast we had each morning fresh and delicious. We will be back.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

It gives me great pleasure to know that you joined us in Bulters Restaurant for lunch and that you found the food to be delicious. We take great pride in our attention to detail here at The Chesterfield and I am glad that you appreciated the added touches of birthday treats for your grandmother. Thank you for your kind words regarding the friendly and helpful service that you experienced through out your stay, I will be sure to share your review with all of my team here. As always, I look forward to welcoming you back to The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. Kind regards, Oliver Oliver Raggett General Manager

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have.

Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM.

All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

Last week-end (August 22nd to 25th) we stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair, our third stay since 2009. The suite we had was very luxurious and met all our expectations.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. I am delighted to hear that your mother had another enjoyable stay with us; we love to welcome back members of our Chesterfield family.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world.

I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious.

That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection.

Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM.

We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï).

On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

I am delighted to learn that after staying at some of our sister properties you chose to join us as The Chesterfield Mayfair to celebrate your grandmotherâs birthday. We enjoy making our guests feel at home with us and I am thrilled that you felt warmly welcomed to the hotel and that you appreciated the larger room for the special occasion. It gives me great pleasure to know that you joined us in Bulters Restaurant for lunch and that you found the food to be delicious. We take great pride in our attention to detail here at The Chesterfield and I am glad that you appreciated the added touches of birthday treats for your grandmother. Thank you for your kind words regarding the friendly and helpful service that you experienced through out your stay, I will be sure to share your review with all of my team here. As always, I look forward to welcoming you back to The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. Kind regards, Oliver Oliver Raggett General Manager

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus.

If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people.

Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work.

All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

Last week-end (August 22nd to 25th) we stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair, our third stay since 2009. The suite we had was very luxurious and met all our expectations. Our long week-end in the heart of London was a great success. We always enjoy staying at The Chesterfield Mayfair and highly recommend it.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. I am delighted to hear that your mother had another enjoyable stay with us; we love to welcome back members of our Chesterfield family. I am thrilled that she appreciated the fruit and personal note in her room and that my team recognised her by name; we love when guests notice our dedication.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only!

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be.

The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution.

The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays.

That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom. The location was perfect literally a minute walk to Berkley Square. The service from all staff was excellent and the English breakfast we had each morning fresh and delicious. We will be back.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

It gives me great pleasure to know that you joined us in Bulters Restaurant for lunch and that you found the food to be delicious. We take great pride in our attention to detail here at The Chesterfield and I am glad that you appreciated the added touches of birthday treats for your grandmother. Thank you for your kind words regarding the friendly and helpful service that you experienced through out your stay, I will be sure to share your review with all of my team here. As always, I look forward to welcoming you back to The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. Kind regards, Oliver Oliver Raggett General Manager

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have.

Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM.

All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

Last week-end (August 22nd to 25th) we stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair, our third stay since 2009. The suite we had was very luxurious and met all our expectations.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. I am delighted to hear that your mother had another enjoyable stay with us; we love to welcome back members of our Chesterfield family.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world.

I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious.

That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection.

Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM.

We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï).

On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

I am delighted to learn that after staying at some of our sister properties you chose to join us as The Chesterfield Mayfair to celebrate your grandmotherâs birthday. We enjoy making our guests feel at home with us and I am thrilled that you felt warmly welcomed to the hotel and that you appreciated the larger room for the special occasion. It gives me great pleasure to know that you joined us in Bulters Restaurant for lunch and that you found the food to be delicious. We take great pride in our attention to detail here at The Chesterfield and I am glad that you appreciated the added touches of birthday treats for your grandmother. Thank you for your kind words regarding the friendly and helpful service that you experienced through out your stay, I will be sure to share your review with all of my team here. As always, I look forward to welcoming you back to The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. Kind regards, Oliver Oliver Raggett General Manager

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus.

If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people.

Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work.

All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

Last week-end (August 22nd to 25th) we stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair, our third stay since 2009. The suite we had was very luxurious and met all our expectations. Our long week-end in the heart of London was a great success. We always enjoy staying at The Chesterfield Mayfair and highly recommend it.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. I am delighted to hear that your mother had another enjoyable stay with us; we love to welcome back members of our Chesterfield family. I am thrilled that she appreciated the fruit and personal note in her room and that my team recognised her by name; we love when guests notice our dedication.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only!

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be.

The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution.

The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays.

That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom. The location was perfect literally a minute walk to Berkley Square. The service from all staff was excellent and the English breakfast we had each morning fresh and delicious. We will be back.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

It gives me great pleasure to know that you joined us in Bulters Restaurant for lunch and that you found the food to be delicious. We take great pride in our attention to detail here at The Chesterfield and I am glad that you appreciated the added touches of birthday treats for your grandmother. Thank you for your kind words regarding the friendly and helpful service that you experienced through out your stay, I will be sure to share your review with all of my team here. As always, I look forward to welcoming you back to The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. Kind regards, Oliver Oliver Raggett General Manager

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have.

Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM.

All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

Last week-end (August 22nd to 25th) we stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair, our third stay since 2009. The suite we had was very luxurious and met all our expectations.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. I am delighted to hear that your mother had another enjoyable stay with us; we love to welcome back members of our Chesterfield family.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world.

I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious.

That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection.

Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM.

We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï).

On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

I am delighted to learn that after staying at some of our sister properties you chose to join us as The Chesterfield Mayfair to celebrate your grandmotherâs birthday. We enjoy making our guests feel at home with us and I am thrilled that you felt warmly welcomed to the hotel and that you appreciated the larger room for the special occasion. It gives me great pleasure to know that you joined us in Bulters Restaurant for lunch and that you found the food to be delicious. We take great pride in our attention to detail here at The Chesterfield and I am glad that you appreciated the added touches of birthday treats for your grandmother. Thank you for your kind words regarding the friendly and helpful service that you experienced through out your stay, I will be sure to share your review with all of my team here. As always, I look forward to welcoming you back to The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. Kind regards, Oliver Oliver Raggett General Manager

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus.

If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people.

Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work.

All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

Last week-end (August 22nd to 25th) we stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair, our third stay since 2009. The suite we had was very luxurious and met all our expectations. Our long week-end in the heart of London was a great success. We always enjoy staying at The Chesterfield Mayfair and highly recommend it.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. I am delighted to hear that your mother had another enjoyable stay with us; we love to welcome back members of our Chesterfield family. I am thrilled that she appreciated the fruit and personal note in her room and that my team recognised her by name; we love when guests notice our dedication.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only!

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be.

The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution.

The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays.

That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom. The location was perfect literally a minute walk to Berkley Square. The service from all staff was excellent and the English breakfast we had each morning fresh and delicious. We will be back.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

It gives me great pleasure to know that you joined us in Bulters Restaurant for lunch and that you found the food to be delicious. We take great pride in our attention to detail here at The Chesterfield and I am glad that you appreciated the added touches of birthday treats for your grandmother. Thank you for your kind words regarding the friendly and helpful service that you experienced through out your stay, I will be sure to share your review with all of my team here. As always, I look forward to welcoming you back to The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. Kind regards, Oliver Oliver Raggett General Manager

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have.

Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM.

All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

Last week-end (August 22nd to 25th) we stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair, our third stay since 2009. The suite we had was very luxurious and met all our expectations.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. I am delighted to hear that your mother had another enjoyable stay with us; we love to welcome back members of our Chesterfield family.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world.

I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious.

That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection.

Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM.

We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï).

On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

I am delighted to learn that after staying at some of our sister properties you chose to join us as The Chesterfield Mayfair to celebrate your grandmotherâs birthday. We enjoy making our guests feel at home with us and I am thrilled that you felt warmly welcomed to the hotel and that you appreciated the larger room for the special occasion. It gives me great pleasure to know that you joined us in Bulters Restaurant for lunch and that you found the food to be delicious. We take great pride in our attention to detail here at The Chesterfield and I am glad that you appreciated the added touches of birthday treats for your grandmother. Thank you for your kind words regarding the friendly and helpful service that you experienced through out your stay, I will be sure to share your review with all of my team here. As always, I look forward to welcoming you back to The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. Kind regards, Oliver Oliver Raggett General Manager

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus.

If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people.

Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work.

All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

Last week-end (August 22nd to 25th) we stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair, our third stay since 2009. The suite we had was very luxurious and met all our expectations. Our long week-end in the heart of London was a great success. We always enjoy staying at The Chesterfield Mayfair and highly recommend it.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. I am delighted to hear that your mother had another enjoyable stay with us; we love to welcome back members of our Chesterfield family. I am thrilled that she appreciated the fruit and personal note in her room and that my team recognised her by name; we love when guests notice our dedication.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only!

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be.

The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution.

The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays.

That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom. The location was perfect literally a minute walk to Berkley Square. The service from all staff was excellent and the English breakfast we had each morning fresh and delicious. We will be back.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

It gives me great pleasure to know that you joined us in Bulters Restaurant for lunch and that you found the food to be delicious. We take great pride in our attention to detail here at The Chesterfield and I am glad that you appreciated the added touches of birthday treats for your grandmother. Thank you for your kind words regarding the friendly and helpful service that you experienced through out your stay, I will be sure to share your review with all of my team here. As always, I look forward to welcoming you back to The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. Kind regards, Oliver Oliver Raggett General Manager

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have.

Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM.

All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

Last week-end (August 22nd to 25th) we stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair, our third stay since 2009. The suite we had was very luxurious and met all our expectations.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. I am delighted to hear that your mother had another enjoyable stay with us; we love to welcome back members of our Chesterfield family.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world.

I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious.

That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection.

Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM.

We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï).

On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

I am delighted to learn that after staying at some of our sister properties you chose to join us as The Chesterfield Mayfair to celebrate your grandmotherâs birthday. We enjoy making our guests feel at home with us and I am thrilled that you felt warmly welcomed to the hotel and that you appreciated the larger room for the special occasion. It gives me great pleasure to know that you joined us in Bulters Restaurant for lunch and that you found the food to be delicious. We take great pride in our attention to detail here at The Chesterfield and I am glad that you appreciated the added touches of birthday treats for your grandmother. Thank you for your kind words regarding the friendly and helpful service that you experienced through out your stay, I will be sure to share your review with all of my team here. As always, I look forward to welcoming you back to The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. Kind regards, Oliver Oliver Raggett General Manager

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus.

If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people.

Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work.

All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

Last week-end (August 22nd to 25th) we stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair, our third stay since 2009. The suite we had was very luxurious and met all our expectations. Our long week-end in the heart of London was a great success. We always enjoy staying at The Chesterfield Mayfair and highly recommend it.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. I am delighted to hear that your mother had another enjoyable stay with us; we love to welcome back members of our Chesterfield family. I am thrilled that she appreciated the fruit and personal note in her room and that my team recognised her by name; we love when guests notice our dedication.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only!

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be.

The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution.

The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays.

That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom. The location was perfect literally a minute walk to Berkley Square. The service from all staff was excellent and the English breakfast we had each morning fresh and delicious. We will be back.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

It gives me great pleasure to know that you joined us in Bulters Restaurant for lunch and that you found the food to be delicious. We take great pride in our attention to detail here at The Chesterfield and I am glad that you appreciated the added touches of birthday treats for your grandmother. Thank you for your kind words regarding the friendly and helpful service that you experienced through out your stay, I will be sure to share your review with all of my team here. As always, I look forward to welcoming you back to The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. Kind regards, Oliver Oliver Raggett General Manager

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have.

Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM.

All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

Last week-end (August 22nd to 25th) we stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair, our third stay since 2009. The suite we had was very luxurious and met all our expectations.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. I am delighted to hear that your mother had another enjoyable stay with us; we love to welcome back members of our Chesterfield family.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world.

I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious.

That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection.

Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM.

We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï).

On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

I am delighted to learn that after staying at some of our sister properties you chose to join us as The Chesterfield Mayfair to celebrate your grandmotherâs birthday. We enjoy making our guests feel at home with us and I am thrilled that you felt warmly welcomed to the hotel and that you appreciated the larger room for the special occasion. It gives me great pleasure to know that you joined us in Bulters Restaurant for lunch and that you found the food to be delicious. We take great pride in our attention to detail here at The Chesterfield and I am glad that you appreciated the added touches of birthday treats for your grandmother. Thank you for your kind words regarding the friendly and helpful service that you experienced through out your stay, I will be sure to share your review with all of my team here. As always, I look forward to welcoming you back to The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. Kind regards, Oliver Oliver Raggett General Manager

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus.

If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people.

Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work.

All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

Last week-end (August 22nd to 25th) we stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair, our third stay since 2009. The suite we had was very luxurious and met all our expectations. Our long week-end in the heart of London was a great success. We always enjoy staying at The Chesterfield Mayfair and highly recommend it.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. I am delighted to hear that your mother had another enjoyable stay with us; we love to welcome back members of our Chesterfield family. I am thrilled that she appreciated the fruit and personal note in her room and that my team recognised her by name; we love when guests notice our dedication.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only!

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be.

The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution.

The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays.

That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom. The location was perfect literally a minute walk to Berkley Square. The service from all staff was excellent and the English breakfast we had each morning fresh and delicious. We will be back.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

It gives me great pleasure to know that you joined us in Bulters Restaurant for lunch and that you found the food to be delicious. We take great pride in our attention to detail here at The Chesterfield and I am glad that you appreciated the added touches of birthday treats for your grandmother. Thank you for your kind words regarding the friendly and helpful service that you experienced through out your stay, I will be sure to share your review with all of my team here. As always, I look forward to welcoming you back to The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. Kind regards, Oliver Oliver Raggett General Manager

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have.

Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM.

All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

Last week-end (August 22nd to 25th) we stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair, our third stay since 2009. The suite we had was very luxurious and met all our expectations.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. I am delighted to hear that your mother had another enjoyable stay with us; we love to welcome back members of our Chesterfield family.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world.

I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious.

That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection.

Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM.

We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï).

On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

I am delighted to learn that after staying at some of our sister properties you chose to join us as The Chesterfield Mayfair to celebrate your grandmotherâs birthday. We enjoy making our guests feel at home with us and I am thrilled that you felt warmly welcomed to the hotel and that you appreciated the larger room for the special occasion. It gives me great pleasure to know that you joined us in Bulters Restaurant for lunch and that you found the food to be delicious. We take great pride in our attention to detail here at The Chesterfield and I am glad that you appreciated the added touches of birthday treats for your grandmother. Thank you for your kind words regarding the friendly and helpful service that you experienced through out your stay, I will be sure to share your review with all of my team here. As always, I look forward to welcoming you back to The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. Kind regards, Oliver Oliver Raggett General Manager

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus.

If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people.

Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work.

All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

Last week-end (August 22nd to 25th) we stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair, our third stay since 2009. The suite we had was very luxurious and met all our expectations. Our long week-end in the heart of London was a great success. We always enjoy staying at The Chesterfield Mayfair and highly recommend it.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. I am delighted to hear that your mother had another enjoyable stay with us; we love to welcome back members of our Chesterfield family. I am thrilled that she appreciated the fruit and personal note in her room and that my team recognised her by name; we love when guests notice our dedication.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only!

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be.

The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution.

The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays.

That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom. The location was perfect literally a minute walk to Berkley Square. The service from all staff was excellent and the English breakfast we had each morning fresh and delicious. We will be back.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

It gives me great pleasure to know that you joined us in Bulters Restaurant for lunch and that you found the food to be delicious. We take great pride in our attention to detail here at The Chesterfield and I am glad that you appreciated the added touches of birthday treats for your grandmother. Thank you for your kind words regarding the friendly and helpful service that you experienced through out your stay, I will be sure to share your review with all of my team here. As always, I look forward to welcoming you back to The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. Kind regards, Oliver Oliver Raggett General Manager

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have.

Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM.

All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

Last week-end (August 22nd to 25th) we stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair, our third stay since 2009. The suite we had was very luxurious and met all our expectations.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. I am delighted to hear that your mother had another enjoyable stay with us; we love to welcome back members of our Chesterfield family.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world.

I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious.

That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection.

Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM.

We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï).

On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

I am delighted to learn that after staying at some of our sister properties you chose to join us as The Chesterfield Mayfair to celebrate your grandmotherâs birthday. We enjoy making our guests feel at home with us and I am thrilled that you felt warmly welcomed to the hotel and that you appreciated the larger room for the special occasion. It gives me great pleasure to know that you joined us in Bulters Restaurant for lunch and that you found the food to be delicious. We take great pride in our attention to detail here at The Chesterfield and I am glad that you appreciated the added touches of birthday treats for your grandmother. Thank you for your kind words regarding the friendly and helpful service that you experienced through out your stay, I will be sure to share your review with all of my team here. As always, I look forward to welcoming you back to The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. Kind regards, Oliver Oliver Raggett General Manager

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus.

If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people.

Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work.

All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

Last week-end (August 22nd to 25th) we stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair, our third stay since 2009. The suite we had was very luxurious and met all our expectations. Our long week-end in the heart of London was a great success. We always enjoy staying at The Chesterfield Mayfair and highly recommend it.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. I am delighted to hear that your mother had another enjoyable stay with us; we love to welcome back members of our Chesterfield family. I am thrilled that she appreciated the fruit and personal note in her room and that my team recognised her by name; we love when guests notice our dedication.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only!

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be.

The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution.

The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays.

That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom. The location was perfect literally a minute walk to Berkley Square. The service from all staff was excellent and the English breakfast we had each morning fresh and delicious. We will be back.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

It gives me great pleasure to know that you joined us in Bulters Restaurant for lunch and that you found the food to be delicious. We take great pride in our attention to detail here at The Chesterfield and I am glad that you appreciated the added touches of birthday treats for your grandmother. Thank you for your kind words regarding the friendly and helpful service that you experienced through out your stay, I will be sure to share your review with all of my team here. As always, I look forward to welcoming you back to The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. Kind regards, Oliver Oliver Raggett General Manager

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have.

Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM.

All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

Last week-end (August 22nd to 25th) we stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair, our third stay since 2009. The suite we had was very luxurious and met all our expectations.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. I am delighted to hear that your mother had another enjoyable stay with us; we love to welcome back members of our Chesterfield family.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world.

I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious.

That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection.

Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM.

We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï).

On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

I am delighted to learn that after staying at some of our sister properties you chose to join us as The Chesterfield Mayfair to celebrate your grandmotherâs birthday. We enjoy making our guests feel at home with us and I am thrilled that you felt warmly welcomed to the hotel and that you appreciated the larger room for the special occasion. It gives me great pleasure to know that you joined us in Bulters Restaurant for lunch and that you found the food to be delicious. We take great pride in our attention to detail here at The Chesterfield and I am glad that you appreciated the added touches of birthday treats for your grandmother. Thank you for your kind words regarding the friendly and helpful service that you experienced through out your stay, I will be sure to share your review with all of my team here. As always, I look forward to welcoming you back to The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. Kind regards, Oliver Oliver Raggett General Manager

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus.

If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people.

Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work.

All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

Last week-end (August 22nd to 25th) we stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair, our third stay since 2009. The suite we had was very luxurious and met all our expectations. Our long week-end in the heart of London was a great success. We always enjoy staying at The Chesterfield Mayfair and highly recommend it.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. I am delighted to hear that your mother had another enjoyable stay with us; we love to welcome back members of our Chesterfield family. I am thrilled that she appreciated the fruit and personal note in her room and that my team recognised her by name; we love when guests notice our dedication.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only!

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be.

The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution.

The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays.

That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom. The location was perfect literally a minute walk to Berkley Square. The service from all staff was excellent and the English breakfast we had each morning fresh and delicious. We will be back.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

It gives me great pleasure to know that you joined us in Bulters Restaurant for lunch and that you found the food to be delicious. We take great pride in our attention to detail here at The Chesterfield and I am glad that you appreciated the added touches of birthday treats for your grandmother. Thank you for your kind words regarding the friendly and helpful service that you experienced through out your stay, I will be sure to share your review with all of my team here. As always, I look forward to welcoming you back to The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. Kind regards, Oliver Oliver Raggett General Manager

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have.

Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM.

All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

Last week-end (August 22nd to 25th) we stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair, our third stay since 2009. The suite we had was very luxurious and met all our expectations.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. I am delighted to hear that your mother had another enjoyable stay with us; we love to welcome back members of our Chesterfield family.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world.

I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious.

That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection.

Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM.

We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï).

On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

I am delighted to learn that after staying at some of our sister properties you chose to join us as The Chesterfield Mayfair to celebrate your grandmotherâs birthday. We enjoy making our guests feel at home with us and I am thrilled that you felt warmly welcomed to the hotel and that you appreciated the larger room for the special occasion. It gives me great pleasure to know that you joined us in Bulters Restaurant for lunch and that you found the food to be delicious. We take great pride in our attention to detail here at The Chesterfield and I am glad that you appreciated the added touches of birthday treats for your grandmother. Thank you for your kind words regarding the friendly and helpful service that you experienced through out your stay, I will be sure to share your review with all of my team here. As always, I look forward to welcoming you back to The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. Kind regards, Oliver Oliver Raggett General Manager

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus.

If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people.

Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work.

All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

Last week-end (August 22nd to 25th) we stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair, our third stay since 2009. The suite we had was very luxurious and met all our expectations. Our long week-end in the heart of London was a great success. We always enjoy staying at The Chesterfield Mayfair and highly recommend it.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. I am delighted to hear that your mother had another enjoyable stay with us; we love to welcome back members of our Chesterfield family. I am thrilled that she appreciated the fruit and personal note in her room and that my team recognised her by name; we love when guests notice our dedication.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only!

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be.

The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution.

The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays.

That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom. The location was perfect literally a minute walk to Berkley Square. The service from all staff was excellent and the English breakfast we had each morning fresh and delicious. We will be back.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

It gives me great pleasure to know that you joined us in Bulters Restaurant for lunch and that you found the food to be delicious. We take great pride in our attention to detail here at The Chesterfield and I am glad that you appreciated the added touches of birthday treats for your grandmother. Thank you for your kind words regarding the friendly and helpful service that you experienced through out your stay, I will be sure to share your review with all of my team here. As always, I look forward to welcoming you back to The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. Kind regards, Oliver Oliver Raggett General Manager

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have.

Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM.

All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

Last week-end (August 22nd to 25th) we stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair, our third stay since 2009. The suite we had was very luxurious and met all our expectations.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. I am delighted to hear that your mother had another enjoyable stay with us; we love to welcome back members of our Chesterfield family.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life.

No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world.

I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints. This year she received a hand written letter from the Manager thanking her for her continuous valued custom together with a bowl of fruit. The concierge greeted her when she arrived - having recognised her from previous years - and knew her name! She said she felt so valued by this hotel and her head had grown the size of the Chesterfield itself! This is old world charm, where every visitor is treated as royalty. Well done!

Dear Guest, Thank you for your great review of your mother's experience at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious.

That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.

My mother returns year after year from South Africa to the Chesterfield. The Chesterfield never disappoints.

Stayed here for 4 nights. First time on London, loved the area and this quaint but opulent hotel. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. Rooms were small, but cozy, I expected this. Beds were so comfortable. The staff were lovely and very helpful. They event surprised us with a signed card from all the team and lovely cupcakes as a for our 22 year anniversary. Thankyou! The area was affluent as expected and had great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants close by. Easy to get cabs, which the doorman hails very quickly so no problem with finding transport. I would recommend this hotel and area to stay in. Hopefully will get to return soon

Wonderful stay this exceptional hotel, everything was perfect The staff and service are outstanding. Our rooms were lovely. All of our Restaurant meals were superb; from breakfast with its outstanding range of options, to the afternoon teas to our wonderful evening meals. The attention to detail at the Chesterfield is second to none; everything seems to be carefully thought of to ensure we enjoyed a unique experience. Location is easily within walking distance of the shops in Oxford Street, Kensington and Knightsbridge together with the typical London attractions. However it is worth taking a few minutes stroll towards Berkeley Square, and window shop for your next car possibly a Bentley or a Rolls or even a Bugatti, if only! Already looking forward to a return visit.

We wanted a very English/Mayfair experience and this beautiful hotel provided exactly that. The room was warm and spacious accompanied by an elegant bathroom. The location was perfect literally a minute walk to Berkley Square. The service from all staff was excellent and the English breakfast we had each morning fresh and delicious. We will be back.

I took my Grandmother to London for a short trip to celebrate her birthday and stay at The Chesterfield. Having stayed at red carnation hotels before including The Milestone in London I had high expectations and I am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in the staff made my Grandmother & I feel very welcome. We had been upgraded as it was a special occasion which was much appreciated and she was accompanied arm in arm to our suite which made her feel very special. We also ate lunch in the restuarant which was delightful and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Upon arrival back at the hotel later in the day we arrived in the room to find a birthday card and small birthday cake for my grandmother which made her day and I would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for helping make her stay in London a special one. Every single member of the team was polite, helpful and very attentive, a credit to the red carnation group - with special mention to the front of house/reception team. Last but not least the breakfast was also delicious, I would highly recommend staying here and will be back again.

CHESTERFIELD MAYFAIR HOTEL, LONDON, ENGLAND The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel (CMH) in the Mayfair borough of London, a Red Carnation boutique establishment, was selected by my wife after a long Internet and personal networking process. The CMH is nicely located for walking to venues or to access transportation, tube or bus. It is on a quiet semi-residential street only a few blocks from Berkeley Square, a pleasant place, and less than that to a nice pub. If you want to walk around and get your head swiveled by passing Ferraris, Maseratis and Lamborghinis, then this is the neighborhood for you! I saw more of them in a week than in my entire life. Someone(s) in the neighborhood has serious money. My wife can be compulsive as she sets out to plan a trip, in this case her birthday present. No, I was deemed unable (incompetent?) to do it and no, I cannot divulge which birthday. The last time we had been in London was 43 years ago, which does not exactly help anyone find a nice, well-located hotel in todayâs world. However, the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel is one such abode though it is not idyllic. I actually like that because my reality is not replete with perfection. Some of what I am about to relate is affected by the cogent realization that we are more night than day people whereas nearly three quarters of the worldâs inhabitants are morning people. For this reason, we rarely go traveling with tours and generally eat breakfast shortly after most others have finished lunch. We received an unusual and heartwarming email from the CMH asking us for certain of our preferences, including what kind of pillows we would like to have. I wrote in at the bottom that we would like a quiet room, too (as am burdened with a lifelong sensitivity to noise and unexpected sounds, with hearing that used to be like a dogâs, literally). I can tell you from personal experience that humans should not hear things dogs hear. Alas, we were put into one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel. Well, if the room is facing active building construction and itâs adjacent to the double doors at the end of the hallway that conceal the service elevators, mornings are not quiet. Though it might be better on construction-free Sundays, there is no respite from daily hotel service, a mixed blessing. Now, if you are a morning person, you are out of the room and blissfully unaware of this impending auditory onslaught. Later on, we learned that this hotel is on someoneâs published list of quiet hotels in England (a list I have not seen). After several days I spoke to the hotelâs assistant manager and negotiated an increased rate for a larger, quiet room, a junior suite. Our room (201) was nicely appointed but not spacious, though it was not tiny as European hotel rooms can be. We looked forward to the change, which occurred after a delightful, cultural day and evening out. Well, we came back after midnight to a smaller room (at the higher negotiated rate!) facing the same construction, which I specifically asked to avoid. Being an astute and patient reader, you already surmised that this was not going to work. The hotelâs night manager recognized the problem in its entirety and we wound up in one of the deluxe hotel suites at the same rate as our original room, by 3 AM. No problem for us, da night people. Before going further, the above is a good introduction to the behavior of the hotelâs staff and management. They were always gracious, friendly, resourceful and tried to be helpful at every turn. Obviously, retraining needed to be done with some of their people, which the hotelâs general manager told me was already in progress. It was good to learn that the assistant and night managers communicated effectively with the general manager (the boss), who found us at high tea in their impressive restaurant. He already knew all the details, including all the rooms we were in. In fact, he offered to pave the way for us should we wish to stay in other Red Carnation establishments, elsewhere. I could sum it up by saying we are most pleased with the staffâs behavior, recognizing and admitting to their problems, applying generous fixes and at all times behaving in a most friendly and supportive manner. I believe it is largely due to the hotelâs staff that clients return to the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel time after time. It is easy to spot the returnees if you are near the front desk; the staff knows their names on sight as they are registering. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs room(s): our first room (201) was traditionally decorated but not ostentatious, of pleasing size but not quite large enough to feel spacious. The walls were upholstered, a very nice touch we noted throughout. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of counter space, something desirable and not to be taken for granted. The tub serves for the shower, as well, and the tiled floor is marginally protected from shower spray by a hinged (or fixed) glass panel that sits on the outer edge of the tub; itâs a clumsy and not terribly effective solution. The shower head is directly overhead, unfortunately without the presence of a shower wand. You might find it an interesting challenge to rinse those of your parts below the navel ï. The tub differs from American bathtubs in that it is deeper and considerably narrower. Its high walls make entry and exit more of an athletic feat than you might expect. Furthermore, there are no grab handles, inclining me to believe this just wonât work for some folks. Our rooms (including the deluxe suite) did not have a shower stall, which raises the question as to whether any rooms in the Chesterfield Mayfair are so equipped? Having only a European style bathtub for both tubbing and showering could be a deficit for very big and broad persons as its narrowness will really put the squeeze on. We were pleased that the rooms had individually controllable, constantly running HVAC. We sleep in coldish temperatures and like a monotonous, low grade background fan noise, rather than power misers that stop and start all night long (that drive me nuts). Closet and storage space were generous in our rooms but not in one we reviewed. The Chesterfield Mayfairâs hallways were exceedingly pleasant, including the main, central stairway, which is adorned with oil paintings, lovely carpeting and an impressive brass banister. We used that stairway much more than the pair of elevators, also rather nicely done. My wife openly wondered if we should consider doing something similar to our homeâs staircase; not. The painting near the main floor is a wonderful copy of one we had just seen in the Wallace collectionâ¦ or is the one in the Wallace the copy? I absolutely love the way that man is cradling his dogâs head in his right hand. The stairway complements the feeling of comfortable elegance and coziness that the hotel projects, something quite unobtainable in large, busy, noisy hotels. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotelâs restaurant, Butlers Restaurant, should not be missed, even if you elect to stay elsewhere. The head chef, Ben Cohen, is London born and trained, which would incline you to think his food is ordinary Brit stuff; it isnât. We ate two meals there plus a high tea with a London couple who frequent Browns high tea but had not, yet, done it at Butlers. They felt Butlers Restaurant was at least as good as Browns, if not a shade better, which is high praise as the latter has a solid reputation. Incidentally, the word on Butlers Restaurantâs high tea is spreading so you had better plan ahead with a reservation for a weekend day, though it is not as booked on weekdays. If you can get it, shoot for a table in the solarium. The restaurant is comfortable, well appointed and cozy, craftily using mirrored walls to give you a sense of openness while avoiding the feeling you are eating in the middle of a football field. You are welcome to choose whichever kind of football field gives you the best image. Butlersâs staff is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to call over their young (and very tall) sommelier for questions they cannot field. Of particular interest to us was the daily, baked entrÃ©e specialty served out of a large, rare, silver server that was wheeled up to our table. We sampled it both days and were very pleased. The presentation on the plate and freshness of ingredients was darn good to excellent and always delightful. Whereas we ate in some very good restaurants during our stay, we opined that none were better than Butlers Restaurant and perhaps not even on a par. Bon Appetite! In closing, a brief comment about visiting London, England, and staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel; yes, we do recommend you give this hotel a serious look-over if London is on your goto list. And if London is not on your goto list, put it there. We were impressed with what London had to offer and the way in which it did that. London is more cosmopolitan, international and expansive than any city we have experienced (yes, more than New York City or Paris; ï). London is laced with easy to use subways (the tube) and truly impressive taxi cab drivers. Other than standard historic landmarks and Queen E, London is vastly different and improved in most categories that matter to visitors as compared to our last trip, in our opinion. We were unfailingly impressed with the friendliness of Londoners (contrary to what we read) who volunteered their help at every turn, whether on the street as we pored over a map or in the tube lugging luggage. On a daily basis we met people from all over the world but mostly from the mainland, especially France and Italy. That London is still an upbeat work in progress is testified to by the (many) construction cranes that dot (plague?) its skyline and the sense of upbeatness that Londoners project. Donât miss todayâs London (2014) or its cabbies, none of whom use GPS and all of whom seem to be chatty. All of London is between their ears, unlike Parisian cabbies who are apparently insecure about getting to the corner without a GPS display. London cabbies are charming, pleasant and downright impressive, especially for someone such as me who is genetically devoid of a sense of direction. After due consideration, it may not be a good idea to bring up the 2014 World Cup with anyone in London, cabbies included.
