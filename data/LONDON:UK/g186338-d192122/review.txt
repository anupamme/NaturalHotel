Thank you for a most pleasurable time at the Egerton. Everyone was so nice and the room and service were excellent. We had a wonderful time in the bar with the guests and the opera singing was great. Our breakfast was wonderful. We truly had a wonderful time, even if it was just overnight. We will be back whenever we get back to London.

This hotel stands apart from the many anonymous hotel chains. The outstanding service is personal, with the staff willing to go out if their way to make your time in London special. They are highly knowledgeable on what's going on, what is worth seeing (and what isn't). Always ready to have a chat or offer a cup of tea. It really made us feel most welcome. The rooms are stylish yet comfortable to live in rather than just glamorous to look at. Each room is different. I don't think you can get a better location. 2 blocks from Harrods, a few minutes walk from Hyde park and some of the many museums and interesting sights. I think it's the ideal place to stay, whether you're in town for sightseeing, shopping or business.

Visited Egerton House during a birthday weekend in London for my wife's birthday. I was looking for luxury and attentive service and did not want to go for one of the larger hotels. Egerton House fitted the bill perfectly. From the moment you walk in you are treated to personable and professional service. Every single member of the team we engaged with was superb. Special mention to Antonio in the bar - get him to share a few of his old stories over a cocktail or two. Location is central (2 mins walk to V&A and Harrods) but tucked away off the Main Street. Rooms are not huge but luxuriously decorated. If you are looking for exemplary service in a friendly and intimate surrounding I highly recommend Egerton House.

Fab experience staying just blocks away from South Kensington Tube, museums, famous shopping districts, you are welcomed by a caring staff and gorgeous rooms. Op for English Breakfast to provide daily energy choices- helps fuel your London travel journeys. Egerton has easy access via Heathrow Express / Paddington Station, then take London's famous "black" taxi to hotel through Hyde Park. Hope to stay again in the near future!

The Egerton House Hotel was like my home away from home. They staff made the stay so welcoming and personal. I would go back to this hotel tomorrow if I could! My husband and I walked to Buckingham Palace, to Parliament, to a spot on the corner by Big Ben to watch the Tour de France, shopping at Harrods and so much more. We visited a few restaurants on the way home or on the way out in the morning had a lovely breakfast in the dining room. There are also parks along the way to enjoy. A must stay place for anyone traveling to London!

I have been in the hotel this August. It was a really wonderful staff memorable experience with excellent cleaning and exquisite service. excellent food. repeat finding insurance. a quiet yet very close to all landmarks london hotel. Room Tip: my room was 34 i a really lovely room See more room tips

My family's stay at the Egerton was absolutely fabulous. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left they provided us wonderful customer service. The amenities in the room and in the hotel were beyond extraordinary. If you are an American I will warn you that the rooms are much smaller than you might be used to in American hotels, but please do not let that prevent you from staying here. While our room was a bit close (2 tall adults with two large suitcases and two carryons) we still had a good deal of room and felt very comfortable. The bed was truly the best bed I'd slept on at any hotel I've stayed in around the world. I would thoroughly recommend the Egerton to anyone coming to London. It is also EXTREMELY conveniently located to Tube stops, Harrods, the Victoria and Albert Museum and other wonderful monuments.

It was a great pleasure to stay at the Egerton House Hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our stay did feel like home. The hotel is cosy and offers a lot of special services. Another important reason to stay, the Hotel is situated in a beautiful location as well, near Harrods and other famous sights. We will recommend this Hotel to other visitors!

The physical plant of this hotel is nice enough and the location fine. However, the extremely helpful and attentive staff make this hotel shine. I generally prefer to be left alone while traveling but these folks make their interaction with and assistance to guests effortless (for the guest) without being cloying or obsequient. Because of them this is a wonderful place to stay.

Dear Guest, Thank you so very much for taking the time to review the Egerton House Hotel on TripAdvisor. I am most proud of my team and it really is without them that nothing could be achieved and we wouldnât have the pleasure to read such wonderful reviews like yours. The staff are highly motivated by great service though with added sincerity. I believe this is what makes The Egerton House more of a home than a hotel and Iâm pleased that you felt extremely comfortable. . I very much look forward to welcoming you back on a future visit and thank you for staying with us. Warm wishes, Michelle Devlin General Manager

I,d been to The Egerton several times and each time I arrive , I feel at home. Once I arrive and somebody was waiting for me at The AirPort , this is to be pampered. Excelent driver, excelllent car. When you arrive The team working there is , all of them, helpful , nice and in good mood. The neighbourhood it's perfect, The museum, the park, Brompton Ave and Harrods nearby, and you have also the quiet streets and the small restaurants in the area make The Egerton your Home in London! You SHOULD go! Room Tip: View to the gardens See more room tips

Another important reason to stay, the Hotel is situated in a beautiful location as well, near Harrods and other famous sights. We will recommend this Hotel to other visitors!

The physical plant of this hotel is nice enough and the location fine. However, the extremely helpful and attentive staff make this hotel shine. I generally prefer to be left alone while traveling but these folks make their interaction with and assistance to guests effortless (for the guest) without being cloying or obsequient. Because of them this is a wonderful place to stay.

Dear Guest, Thank you so very much for taking the time to review the Egerton House Hotel on TripAdvisor. I am most proud of my team and it really is without them that nothing could be achieved and we wouldnât have the pleasure to read such wonderful reviews like yours. The staff are highly motivated by great service though with added sincerity. I believe this is what makes The Egerton House more of a home than a hotel and Iâm pleased that you felt extremely comfortable. . I very much look forward to welcoming you back on a future visit and thank you for staying with us. Warm wishes, Michelle Devlin General Manager

I,d been to The Egerton several times and each time I arrive , I feel at home. Once I arrive and somebody was waiting for me at The AirPort , this is to be pampered. Excelent driver, excelllent car. When you arrive The team working there is , all of them, helpful , nice and in good mood. The neighbourhood it's perfect, The museum, the park, Brompton Ave and Harrods nearby, and you have also the quiet streets and the small restaurants in the area make The Egerton your Home in London! You SHOULD go! Room Tip: View to the gardens See more room tips

Dear Guest, Thank you so very much for taking the time to share your experience of The Egerton House Hotel with other TripAdvisor viewers. I am delighted to read of what a fantastic experience you had and I thank you for your compliments toward my team. They are motivated by providing excellent service and they shall be as happy as I am to read your review. Feedback from our guests is so incredibly important to us and yours is so very much appreciated. I very much look forward to welcoming you home once again; hopefully in the not too distant future. Warm wishes, Michelle Devlin General Manager

Thank you for a most pleasurable time at the Egerton. Everyone was so nice and the room and service were excellent. We had a wonderful time in the bar with the guests and the opera singing was great. Our breakfast was wonderful. We truly had a wonderful time, even if it was just overnight. We will be back whenever we get back to London.

This hotel stands apart from the many anonymous hotel chains. The outstanding service is personal, with the staff willing to go out if their way to make your time in London special. They are highly knowledgeable on what's going on, what is worth seeing (and what isn't). Always ready to have a chat or offer a cup of tea. It really made us feel most welcome. The rooms are stylish yet comfortable to live in rather than just glamorous to look at. Each room is different. I don't think you can get a better location. 2 blocks from Harrods, a few minutes walk from Hyde park and some of the many museums and interesting sights. I think it's the ideal place to stay, whether you're in town for sightseeing, shopping or business.

Visited Egerton House during a birthday weekend in London for my wife's birthday. I was looking for luxury and attentive service and did not want to go for one of the larger hotels. Egerton House fitted the bill perfectly. From the moment you walk in you are treated to personable and professional service. Every single member of the team we engaged with was superb. Special mention to Antonio in the bar - get him to share a few of his old stories over a cocktail or two. Location is central (2 mins walk to V&A and Harrods) but tucked away off the Main Street. Rooms are not huge but luxuriously decorated. If you are looking for exemplary service in a friendly and intimate surrounding I highly recommend Egerton House.

Fab experience staying just blocks away from South Kensington Tube, museums, famous shopping districts, you are welcomed by a caring staff and gorgeous rooms. Op for English Breakfast to provide daily energy choices- helps fuel your London travel journeys. Egerton has easy access via Heathrow Express / Paddington Station, then take London's famous "black" taxi to hotel through Hyde Park. Hope to stay again in the near future!

The Egerton House Hotel was like my home away from home. They staff made the stay so welcoming and personal. I would go back to this hotel tomorrow if I could! My husband and I walked to Buckingham Palace, to Parliament, to a spot on the corner by Big Ben to watch the Tour de France, shopping at Harrods and so much more. We visited a few restaurants on the way home or on the way out in the morning had a lovely breakfast in the dining room. There are also parks along the way to enjoy. A must stay place for anyone traveling to London!

I have been in the hotel this August. It was a really wonderful staff memorable experience with excellent cleaning and exquisite service. excellent food. repeat finding insurance. a quiet yet very close to all landmarks london hotel. Room Tip: my room was 34 i a really lovely room See more room tips

My family's stay at the Egerton was absolutely fabulous. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left they provided us wonderful customer service. The amenities in the room and in the hotel were beyond extraordinary. If you are an American I will warn you that the rooms are much smaller than you might be used to in American hotels, but please do not let that prevent you from staying here. While our room was a bit close (2 tall adults with two large suitcases and two carryons) we still had a good deal of room and felt very comfortable. The bed was truly the best bed I'd slept on at any hotel I've stayed in around the world. I would thoroughly recommend the Egerton to anyone coming to London. It is also EXTREMELY conveniently located to Tube stops, Harrods, the Victoria and Albert Museum and other wonderful monuments.

Special mention to Antonio in the bar - get him to share a few of his old stories over a cocktail or two. Location is central (2 mins walk to V&A and Harrods) but tucked away off the Main Street. Rooms are not huge but luxuriously decorated. If you are looking for exemplary service in a friendly and intimate surrounding I highly recommend Egerton House.

Fab experience staying just blocks away from South Kensington Tube, museums, famous shopping districts, you are welcomed by a caring staff and gorgeous rooms. Op for English Breakfast to provide daily energy choices- helps fuel your London travel journeys. Egerton has easy access via Heathrow Express / Paddington Station, then take London's famous "black" taxi to hotel through Hyde Park. Hope to stay again in the near future! Room Tip: Upper floors in back...very quiet. See more room tips

The Egerton House Hotel was like my home away from home. They staff made the stay so welcoming and personal. I would go back to this hotel tomorrow if I could! My husband and I walked to Buckingham Palace, to Parliament, to a spot on the corner by Big Ben to watch the Tour de France, shopping at Harrods and so much more. We visited a few restaurants on the way home or on the way out in the morning had a lovely breakfast in the dining room. There are also parks along the way to enjoy. A must stay place for anyone traveling to London!

I have been in the hotel this August. It was a really wonderful staff memorable experience with excellent cleaning and exquisite service. excellent food. repeat finding insurance. a quiet yet very close to all landmarks london hotel. Room Tip: my room was 34 i a really lovely room See more room tips

My family's stay at the Egerton was absolutely fabulous. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left they provided us wonderful customer service. The amenities in the room and in the hotel were beyond extraordinary. If you are an American I will warn you that the rooms are much smaller than you might be used to in American hotels, but please do not let that prevent you from staying here. While our room was a bit close (2 tall adults with two large suitcases and two carryons) we still had a good deal of room and felt very comfortable. The bed was truly the best bed I'd slept on at any hotel I've stayed in around the world. I would thoroughly recommend the Egerton to anyone coming to London. It is also EXTREMELY conveniently located to Tube stops, Harrods, the Victoria and Albert Museum and other wonderful monuments.

It was a great pleasure to stay at the Egerton House Hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our stay did feel like home. The hotel is cosy and offers a lot of special services. Another important reason to stay, the Hotel is situated in a beautiful location as well, near Harrods and other famous sights. We will recommend this Hotel to other visitors!

The physical plant of this hotel is nice enough and the location fine. However, the extremely helpful and attentive staff make this hotel shine. I generally prefer to be left alone while traveling but these folks make their interaction with and assistance to guests effortless (for the guest) without being cloying or obsequient. Because of them this is a wonderful place to stay.

Dear Guest, Thank you so very much for taking the time to review the Egerton House Hotel on TripAdvisor. I am most proud of my team and it really is without them that nothing could be achieved and we wouldnât have the pleasure to read such wonderful reviews like yours. The staff are highly motivated by great service though with added sincerity. I believe this is what makes The Egerton House more of a home than a hotel and Iâm pleased that you felt extremely comfortable. . I very much look forward to welcoming you back on a future visit and thank you for staying with us. Warm wishes, Michelle Devlin General Manager

I,d been to The Egerton several times and each time I arrive , I feel at home. Once I arrive and somebody was waiting for me at The AirPort , this is to be pampered. Excelent driver, excelllent car. When you arrive The team working there is , all of them, helpful , nice and in good mood. The neighbourhood it's perfect, The museum, the park, Brompton Ave and Harrods nearby, and you have also the quiet streets and the small restaurants in the area make The Egerton your Home in London! You SHOULD go! Room Tip: View to the gardens See more room tips

Dear Guest, Thank you so very much for taking the time to share your experience of The Egerton House Hotel with other TripAdvisor viewers.

Thank you for a most pleasurable time at the Egerton. Everyone was so nice and the room and service were excellent. We had a wonderful time in the bar with the guests and the opera singing was great. Our breakfast was wonderful. We truly had a wonderful time, even if it was just overnight. We will be back whenever we get back to London.

This hotel stands apart from the many anonymous hotel chains. The outstanding service is personal, with the staff willing to go out if their way to make your time in London special. They are highly knowledgeable on what's going on, what is worth seeing (and what isn't). Always ready to have a chat or offer a cup of tea. It really made us feel most welcome. The rooms are stylish yet comfortable to live in rather than just glamorous to look at. Each room is different. I don't think you can get a better location. 2 blocks from Harrods, a few minutes walk from Hyde park and some of the many museums and interesting sights. I think it's the ideal place to stay, whether you're in town for sightseeing, shopping or business.

I,d been to The Egerton several times and each time I arrive , I feel at home. Once I arrive and somebody was waiting for me at The AirPort , this is to be pampered. Excelent driver, excelllent car. When you arrive The team working there is , all of them, helpful , nice and in good mood. The neighbourhood it's perfect, The museum, the park, Brompton Ave and Harrods nearby, and you have also the quiet streets and the small restaurants in the area make The Egerton your Home in London! You SHOULD go! Room Tip: View to the gardens See more room tips

Dear Guest, Thank you so very much for taking the time to share your experience of The Egerton House Hotel with other TripAdvisor viewers. I am delighted to read of what a fantastic experience you had and I thank you for your compliments toward my team. They are motivated by providing excellent service and they shall be as happy as I am to read your review. Feedback from our guests is so incredibly important to us and yours is so very much appreciated. I very much look forward to welcoming you home once again; hopefully in the not too distant future. Warm wishes, Michelle Devlin General Manager

Thank you for a most pleasurable time at the Egerton. Everyone was so nice and the room and service were excellent. We had a wonderful time in the bar with the guests and the opera singing was great. Our breakfast was wonderful. We truly had a wonderful time, even if it was just overnight. We will be back whenever we get back to London.

This hotel stands apart from the many anonymous hotel chains. The outstanding service is personal, with the staff willing to go out if their way to make your time in London special. They are highly knowledgeable on what's going on, what is worth seeing (and what isn't). Always ready to have a chat or offer a cup of tea. It really made us feel most welcome. The rooms are stylish yet comfortable to live in rather than just glamorous to look at. Each room is different. I don't think you can get a better location. 2 blocks from Harrods, a few minutes walk from Hyde park and some of the many museums and interesting sights. I think it's the ideal place to stay, whether you're in town for sightseeing, shopping or business.

Visited Egerton House during a birthday weekend in London for my wife's birthday. I was looking for luxury and attentive service and did not want to go for one of the larger hotels. Egerton House fitted the bill perfectly. From the moment you walk in you are treated to personable and professional service. Every single member of the team we engaged with was superb. Special mention to Antonio in the bar - get him to share a few of his old stories over a cocktail or two. Location is central (2 mins walk to V&A and Harrods) but tucked away off the Main Street. Rooms are not huge but luxuriously decorated. If you are looking for exemplary service in a friendly and intimate surrounding I highly recommend Egerton House.

Fab experience staying just blocks away from South Kensington Tube, museums, famous shopping districts, you are welcomed by a caring staff and gorgeous rooms. Op for English Breakfast to provide daily energy choices- helps fuel your London travel journeys. Egerton has easy access via Heathrow Express / Paddington Station, then take London's famous "black" taxi to hotel through Hyde Park. Hope to stay again in the near future!

The Egerton House Hotel was like my home away from home. They staff made the stay so welcoming and personal. I would go back to this hotel tomorrow if I could! My husband and I walked to Buckingham Palace, to Parliament, to a spot on the corner by Big Ben to watch the Tour de France, shopping at Harrods and so much more. We visited a few restaurants on the way home or on the way out in the morning had a lovely breakfast in the dining room. There are also parks along the way to enjoy. A must stay place for anyone traveling to London!

I have been in the hotel this August. It was a really wonderful staff memorable experience with excellent cleaning and exquisite service. excellent food. repeat finding insurance. a quiet yet very close to all landmarks london hotel. Room Tip: my room was 34 i a really lovely room See more room tips

My family's stay at the Egerton was absolutely fabulous. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left they provided us wonderful customer service. The amenities in the room and in the hotel were beyond extraordinary. If you are an American I will warn you that the rooms are much smaller than you might be used to in American hotels, but please do not let that prevent you from staying here. While our room was a bit close (2 tall adults with two large suitcases and two carryons) we still had a good deal of room and felt very comfortable. The bed was truly the best bed I'd slept on at any hotel I've stayed in around the world. I would thoroughly recommend the Egerton to anyone coming to London. It is also EXTREMELY conveniently located to Tube stops, Harrods, the Victoria and Albert Museum and other wonderful monuments.

It was a great pleasure to stay at the Egerton House Hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our stay did feel like home. The hotel is cosy and offers a lot of special services. Another important reason to stay, the Hotel is situated in a beautiful location as well, near Harrods and other famous sights. We will recommend this Hotel to other visitors!

The physical plant of this hotel is nice enough and the location fine. However, the extremely helpful and attentive staff make this hotel shine. I generally prefer to be left alone while traveling but these folks make their interaction with and assistance to guests effortless (for the guest) without being cloying or obsequient. Because of them this is a wonderful place to stay.

Dear Guest, Thank you so very much for taking the time to review the Egerton House Hotel on TripAdvisor.

We visited a few restaurants on the way home or on the way out in the morning had a lovely breakfast in the dining room. There are also parks along the way to enjoy. A must stay place for anyone traveling to London!

I have been in the hotel this August. It was a really wonderful staff memorable experience with excellent cleaning and exquisite service. excellent food. repeat finding insurance. a quiet yet very close to all landmarks london hotel.

My family's stay at the Egerton was absolutely fabulous. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left they provided us wonderful customer service. The amenities in the room and in the hotel were beyond extraordinary. If you are an American I will warn you that the rooms are much smaller than you might be used to in American hotels, but please do not let that prevent you from staying here. While our room was a bit close (2 tall adults with two large suitcases and two carryons) we still had a good deal of room and felt very comfortable. The bed was truly the best bed I'd slept on at any hotel I've stayed in around the world. I would thoroughly recommend the Egerton to anyone coming to London. It is also EXTREMELY conveniently located to Tube stops, Harrods, the Victoria and Albert Museum and other wonderful monuments.

It was a great pleasure to stay at the Egerton House Hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our stay did feel like home. The hotel is cosy and offers a lot of special services. Another important reason to stay, the Hotel is situated in a beautiful location as well, near Harrods and other famous sights. We will recommend this Hotel to other visitors!

The physical plant of this hotel is nice enough and the location fine. However, the extremely helpful and attentive staff make this hotel shine. I generally prefer to be left alone while traveling but these folks make their interaction with and assistance to guests effortless (for the guest) without being cloying or obsequient. Because of them this is a wonderful place to stay.

Dear Guest, Thank you so very much for taking the time to review the Egerton House Hotel on TripAdvisor. I am most proud of my team and it really is without them that nothing could be achieved and we wouldnât have the pleasure to read such wonderful reviews like yours. The staff are highly motivated by great service though with added sincerity. I believe this is what makes The Egerton House more of a home than a hotel and Iâm pleased that you felt extremely comfortable. . I very much look forward to welcoming you back on a future visit and thank you for staying with us. Warm wishes, Michelle Devlin General Manager

I,d been to The Egerton several times and each time I arrive , I feel at home. Once I arrive and somebody was waiting for me at The AirPort , this is to be pampered. Excelent driver, excelllent car. When you arrive The team working there is , all of them, helpful , nice and in good mood. The neighbourhood it's perfect, The museum, the park, Brompton Ave and Harrods nearby, and you have also the quiet streets and the small restaurants in the area make The Egerton your Home in London! You SHOULD go! Room Tip: View to the gardens See more room tips

Dear Guest, Thank you so very much for taking the time to share your experience of The Egerton House Hotel with other TripAdvisor viewers. I am delighted to read of what a fantastic experience you had and I thank you for your compliments toward my team. They are motivated by providing excellent service and they shall be as happy as I am to read your review. Feedback from our guests is so incredibly important to us and yours is so very much appreciated. I very much look forward to welcoming you home once again; hopefully in the not too distant future.

Thank you for a most pleasurable time at the Egerton. Everyone was so nice and the room and service were excellent. We had a wonderful time in the bar with the guests and the opera singing was great. Our breakfast was wonderful. We truly had a wonderful time, even if it was just overnight. We will be back whenever we get back to London.

This hotel stands apart from the many anonymous hotel chains. The outstanding service is personal, with the staff willing to go out if their way to make your time in London special. They are highly knowledgeable on what's going on, what is worth seeing (and what isn't). Always ready to have a chat or offer a cup of tea. It really made us feel most welcome. The rooms are stylish yet comfortable to live in rather than just glamorous to look at. Each room is different. I don't think you can get a better location. 2 blocks from Harrods, a few minutes walk from Hyde park and some of the many museums and interesting sights. I think it's the ideal place to stay, whether you're in town for sightseeing, shopping or business.

Visited Egerton House during a birthday weekend in London for my wife's birthday. I was looking for luxury and attentive service and did not want to go for one of the larger hotels. Egerton House fitted the bill perfectly. From the moment you walk in you are treated to personable and professional service. Every single member of the team we engaged with was superb. Special mention to Antonio in the bar - get him to share a few of his old stories over a cocktail or two. Location is central (2 mins walk to V&A and Harrods) but tucked away off the Main Street. Rooms are not huge but luxuriously decorated. If you are looking for exemplary service in a friendly and intimate surrounding I highly recommend Egerton House.

Fab experience staying just blocks away from South Kensington Tube, museums, famous shopping districts, you are welcomed by a caring staff and gorgeous rooms. Op for English Breakfast to provide daily energy choices- helps fuel your London travel journeys. Egerton has easy access via Heathrow Express / Paddington Station, then take London's famous "black" taxi to hotel through Hyde Park. Hope to stay again in the near future!

Thank you for a most pleasurable time at the Egerton. Everyone was so nice and the room and service were excellent. We had a wonderful time in the bar with the guests and the opera singing was great. Our breakfast was wonderful. We truly had a wonderful time, even if it was just overnight. We will be back whenever we get back to London.

This hotel stands apart from the many anonymous hotel chains. The outstanding service is personal, with the staff willing to go out if their way to make your time in London special. They are highly knowledgeable on what's going on, what is worth seeing (and what isn't). Always ready to have a chat or offer a cup of tea. It really made us feel most welcome. The rooms are stylish yet comfortable to live in rather than just glamorous to look at. Each room is different. I don't think you can get a better location. 2 blocks from Harrods, a few minutes walk from Hyde park and some of the many museums and interesting sights. I think it's the ideal place to stay, whether you're in town for sightseeing, shopping or business.

Visited Egerton House during a birthday weekend in London for my wife's birthday. I was looking for luxury and attentive service and did not want to go for one of the larger hotels. Egerton House fitted the bill perfectly. From the moment you walk in you are treated to personable and professional service. Every single member of the team we engaged with was superb. Special mention to Antonio in the bar - get him to share a few of his old stories over a cocktail or two. Location is central (2 mins walk to V&A and Harrods) but tucked away off the Main Street. Rooms are not huge but luxuriously decorated. If you are looking for exemplary service in a friendly and intimate surrounding I highly recommend Egerton House.

Fab experience staying just blocks away from South Kensington Tube, museums, famous shopping districts, you are welcomed by a caring staff and gorgeous rooms. Op for English Breakfast to provide daily energy choices- helps fuel your London travel journeys. Egerton has easy access via Heathrow Express / Paddington Station, then take London's famous "black" taxi to hotel through Hyde Park. Hope to stay again in the near future!

The Egerton House Hotel was like my home away from home. They staff made the stay so welcoming and personal. I would go back to this hotel tomorrow if I could! My husband and I walked to Buckingham Palace, to Parliament, to a spot on the corner by Big Ben to watch the Tour de France, shopping at Harrods and so much more. We visited a few restaurants on the way home or on the way out in the morning had a lovely breakfast in the dining room. There are also parks along the way to enjoy. A must stay place for anyone traveling to London!

I have been in the hotel this August. It was a really wonderful staff memorable experience with excellent cleaning and exquisite service. excellent food. repeat finding insurance. a quiet yet very close to all landmarks london hotel. Room Tip: my room was 34 i a really lovely room See more room tips

My family's stay at the Egerton was absolutely fabulous. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left they provided us wonderful customer service. The amenities in the room and in the hotel were beyond extraordinary. If you are an American I will warn you that the rooms are much smaller than you might be used to in American hotels, but please do not let that prevent you from staying here. While our room was a bit close (2 tall adults with two large suitcases and two carryons) we still had a good deal of room and felt very comfortable. The bed was truly the best bed I'd slept on at any hotel I've stayed in around the world. I would thoroughly recommend the Egerton to anyone coming to London. It is also EXTREMELY conveniently located to Tube stops, Harrods, the Victoria and Albert Museum and other wonderful monuments.

It was a great pleasure to stay at the Egerton House Hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our stay did feel like home. The hotel is cosy and offers a lot of special services. Another important reason to stay, the Hotel is situated in a beautiful location as well, near Harrods and other famous sights. We will recommend this Hotel to other visitors!

The physical plant of this hotel is nice enough and the location fine. However, the extremely helpful and attentive staff make this hotel shine. I generally prefer to be left alone while traveling but these folks make their interaction with and assistance to guests effortless (for the guest) without being cloying or obsequient. Because of them this is a wonderful place to stay.

Dear Guest, Thank you so very much for taking the time to review the Egerton House Hotel on TripAdvisor. I am most proud of my team and it really is without them that nothing could be achieved and we wouldnât have the pleasure to read such wonderful reviews like yours. The staff are highly motivated by great service though with added sincerity. I believe this is what makes The Egerton House more of a home than a hotel and Iâm pleased that you felt extremely comfortable. . I very much look forward to welcoming you back on a future visit and thank you for staying with us. Warm wishes, Michelle Devlin General Manager

I,d been to The Egerton several times and each time I arrive , I feel at home. Once I arrive and somebody was waiting for me at The AirPort , this is to be pampered. Excelent driver, excelllent car. When you arrive The team working there is , all of them, helpful , nice and in good mood. The neighbourhood it's perfect, The museum, the park, Brompton Ave and Harrods nearby, and you have also the quiet streets and the small restaurants in the area make The Egerton your Home in London! You SHOULD go! Room Tip: View to the gardens See more room tips

It is also EXTREMELY conveniently located to Tube stops, Harrods, the Victoria and Albert Museum and other wonderful monuments.

It was a great pleasure to stay at the Egerton House Hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our stay did feel like home. The hotel is cosy and offers a lot of special services. Another important reason to stay, the Hotel is situated in a beautiful location as well, near Harrods and other famous sights. We will recommend this Hotel to other visitors!

The physical plant of this hotel is nice enough and the location fine. However, the extremely helpful and attentive staff make this hotel shine. I generally prefer to be left alone while traveling but these folks make their interaction with and assistance to guests effortless (for the guest) without being cloying or obsequient. Because of them this is a wonderful place to stay.

Dear Guest, Thank you so very much for taking the time to review the Egerton House Hotel on TripAdvisor. I am most proud of my team and it really is without them that nothing could be achieved and we wouldnât have the pleasure to read such wonderful reviews like yours. The staff are highly motivated by great service though with added sincerity. I believe this is what makes The Egerton House more of a home than a hotel and Iâm pleased that you felt extremely comfortable. . I very much look forward to welcoming you back on a future visit and thank you for staying with us. Warm wishes, Michelle Devlin General Manager

I,d been to The Egerton several times and each time I arrive , I feel at home. Once I arrive and somebody was waiting for me at The AirPort , this is to be pampered. Excelent driver, excelllent car. When you arrive The team working there is , all of them, helpful , nice and in good mood. The neighbourhood it's perfect, The museum, the park, Brompton Ave and Harrods nearby, and you have also the quiet streets and the small restaurants in the area make The Egerton your Home in London! You SHOULD go! Room Tip: View to the gardens See more room tips

Dear Guest, Thank you so very much for taking the time to share your experience of The Egerton House Hotel with other TripAdvisor viewers. I am delighted to read of what a fantastic experience you had and I thank you for your compliments toward my team. They are motivated by providing excellent service and they shall be as happy as I am to read your review. Feedback from our guests is so incredibly important to us and yours is so very much appreciated. I very much look forward to welcoming you home once again; hopefully in the not too distant future. Warm wishes, Michelle Devlin General Manager

Thank you for a most pleasurable time at the Egerton. Everyone was so nice and the room and service were excellent. We had a wonderful time in the bar with the guests and the opera singing was great. Our breakfast was wonderful. We truly had a wonderful time, even if it was just overnight. We will be back whenever we get back to London.

This hotel stands apart from the many anonymous hotel chains. The outstanding service is personal, with the staff willing to go out if their way to make your time in London special. They are highly knowledgeable on what's going on, what is worth seeing (and what isn't). Always ready to have a chat or offer a cup of tea. It really made us feel most welcome. The rooms are stylish yet comfortable to live in rather than just glamorous to look at. Each room is different. I don't think you can get a better location. 2 blocks from Harrods, a few minutes walk from Hyde park and some of the many museums and interesting sights. I think it's the ideal place to stay, whether you're in town for sightseeing, shopping or business.

Visited Egerton House during a birthday weekend in London for my wife's birthday. I was looking for luxury and attentive service and did not want to go for one of the larger hotels. Egerton House fitted the bill perfectly. From the moment you walk in you are treated to personable and professional service. Every single member of the team we engaged with was superb. Special mention to Antonio in the bar - get him to share a few of his old stories over a cocktail or two. Location is central (2 mins walk to V&A and Harrods) but tucked away off the Main Street. Rooms are not huge but luxuriously decorated. If you are looking for exemplary service in a friendly and intimate surrounding I highly recommend Egerton House.

Fab experience staying just blocks away from South Kensington Tube, museums, famous shopping districts, you are welcomed by a caring staff and gorgeous rooms. Op for English Breakfast to provide daily energy choices- helps fuel your London travel journeys. Egerton has easy access via Heathrow Express / Paddington Station, then take London's famous "black" taxi to hotel through Hyde Park. Hope to stay again in the near future!

The Egerton House Hotel was like my home away from home. They staff made the stay so welcoming and personal. I would go back to this hotel tomorrow if I could! My husband and I walked to Buckingham Palace, to Parliament, to a spot on the corner by Big Ben to watch the Tour de France, shopping at Harrods and so much more. We visited a few restaurants on the way home or on the way out in the morning had a lovely breakfast in the dining room. There are also parks along the way to enjoy. A must stay place for anyone traveling to London!

I have been in the hotel this August. It was a really wonderful staff memorable experience with excellent cleaning and exquisite service. excellent food. repeat finding insurance. a quiet yet very close to all landmarks london hotel.

My family's stay at the Egerton was absolutely fabulous. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left they provided us wonderful customer service. The amenities in the room and in the hotel were beyond extraordinary. If you are an American I will warn you that the rooms are much smaller than you might be used to in American hotels, but please do not let that prevent you from staying here.

Visited Egerton House during a birthday weekend in London for my wife's birthday. I was looking for luxury and attentive service and did not want to go for one of the larger hotels. Egerton House fitted the bill perfectly. From the moment you walk in you are treated to personable and professional service. Every single member of the team we engaged with was superb. Special mention to Antonio in the bar - get him to share a few of his old stories over a cocktail or two. Location is central (2 mins walk to V&A and Harrods) but tucked away off the Main Street. Rooms are not huge but luxuriously decorated. If you are looking for exemplary service in a friendly and intimate surrounding I highly recommend Egerton House.

Fab experience staying just blocks away from South Kensington Tube, museums, famous shopping districts, you are welcomed by a caring staff and gorgeous rooms. Op for English Breakfast to provide daily energy choices- helps fuel your London travel journeys. Egerton has easy access via Heathrow Express / Paddington Station, then take London's famous "black" taxi to hotel through Hyde Park. Hope to stay again in the near future!

The Egerton House Hotel was like my home away from home. They staff made the stay so welcoming and personal. I would go back to this hotel tomorrow if I could! My husband and I walked to Buckingham Palace, to Parliament, to a spot on the corner by Big Ben to watch the Tour de France, shopping at Harrods and so much more. We visited a few restaurants on the way home or on the way out in the morning had a lovely breakfast in the dining room. There are also parks along the way to enjoy. A must stay place for anyone traveling to London!

I have been in the hotel this August. It was a really wonderful staff memorable experience with excellent cleaning and exquisite service. excellent food. repeat finding insurance. a quiet yet very close to all landmarks london hotel. Room Tip: my room was 34 i a really lovely room See more room tips

My family's stay at the Egerton was absolutely fabulous. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left they provided us wonderful customer service. The amenities in the room and in the hotel were beyond extraordinary. If you are an American I will warn you that the rooms are much smaller than you might be used to in American hotels, but please do not let that prevent you from staying here. While our room was a bit close (2 tall adults with two large suitcases and two carryons) we still had a good deal of room and felt very comfortable. The bed was truly the best bed I'd slept on at any hotel I've stayed in around the world. I would thoroughly recommend the Egerton to anyone coming to London. It is also EXTREMELY conveniently located to Tube stops, Harrods, the Victoria and Albert Museum and other wonderful monuments.

It was a great pleasure to stay at the Egerton House Hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our stay did feel like home. The hotel is cosy and offers a lot of special services. Another important reason to stay, the Hotel is situated in a beautiful location as well, near Harrods and other famous sights. We will recommend this Hotel to other visitors!

The physical plant of this hotel is nice enough and the location fine. However, the extremely helpful and attentive staff make this hotel shine. I generally prefer to be left alone while traveling but these folks make their interaction with and assistance to guests effortless (for the guest) without being cloying or obsequient. Because of them this is a wonderful place to stay.

Dear Guest, Thank you so very much for taking the time to review the Egerton House Hotel on TripAdvisor. I am most proud of my team and it really is without them that nothing could be achieved and we wouldnât have the pleasure to read such wonderful reviews like yours. The staff are highly motivated by great service though with added sincerity. I believe this is what makes The Egerton House more of a home than a hotel and Iâm pleased that you felt extremely comfortable. . I very much look forward to welcoming you back on a future visit and thank you for staying with us. Warm wishes, Michelle Devlin General Manager

I,d been to The Egerton several times and each time I arrive , I feel at home. Once I arrive and somebody was waiting for me at The AirPort , this is to be pampered. Excelent driver, excelllent car. When you arrive The team working there is , all of them, helpful , nice and in good mood. The neighbourhood it's perfect, The museum, the park, Brompton Ave and Harrods nearby, and you have also the quiet streets and the small restaurants in the area make The Egerton your Home in London! You SHOULD go! Room Tip: View to the gardens See more room tips

Thank you for a most pleasurable time at the Egerton. Everyone was so nice and the room and service were excellent. We had a wonderful time in the bar with the guests and the opera singing was great. Our breakfast was wonderful. We truly had a wonderful time, even if it was just overnight. We will be back whenever we get back to London.

This hotel stands apart from the many anonymous hotel chains. The outstanding service is personal, with the staff willing to go out if their way to make your time in London special. They are highly knowledgeable on what's going on, what is worth seeing (and what isn't). Always ready to have a chat or offer a cup of tea. It really made us feel most welcome. The rooms are stylish yet comfortable to live in rather than just glamorous to look at. Each room is different. I don't think you can get a better location. 2 blocks from Harrods, a few minutes walk from Hyde park and some of the many museums and interesting sights.

I believe this is what makes The Egerton House more of a home than a hotel and Iâm pleased that you felt extremely comfortable. . I very much look forward to welcoming you back on a future visit and thank you for staying with us. Warm wishes, Michelle Devlin General Manager

I,d been to The Egerton several times and each time I arrive , I feel at home. Once I arrive and somebody was waiting for me at The AirPort , this is to be pampered. Excelent driver, excelllent car. When you arrive The team working there is , all of them, helpful , nice and in good mood. The neighbourhood it's perfect, The museum, the park, Brompton Ave and Harrods nearby, and you have also the quiet streets and the small restaurants in the area make The Egerton your Home in London! You SHOULD go! Room Tip: View to the gardens See more room tips

Dear Guest, Thank you so very much for taking the time to share your experience of The Egerton House Hotel with other TripAdvisor viewers. I am delighted to read of what a fantastic experience you had and I thank you for your compliments toward my team. They are motivated by providing excellent service and they shall be as happy as I am to read your review. Feedback from our guests is so incredibly important to us and yours is so very much appreciated. I very much look forward to welcoming you home once again; hopefully in the not too distant future. Warm wishes, Michelle Devlin General Manager

Thank you for a most pleasurable time at the Egerton. Everyone was so nice and the room and service were excellent. We had a wonderful time in the bar with the guests and the opera singing was great. Our breakfast was wonderful. We truly had a wonderful time, even if it was just overnight. We will be back whenever we get back to London.

This hotel stands apart from the many anonymous hotel chains. The outstanding service is personal, with the staff willing to go out if their way to make your time in London special. They are highly knowledgeable on what's going on, what is worth seeing (and what isn't). Always ready to have a chat or offer a cup of tea. It really made us feel most welcome. The rooms are stylish yet comfortable to live in rather than just glamorous to look at. Each room is different. I don't think you can get a better location. 2 blocks from Harrods, a few minutes walk from Hyde park and some of the many museums and interesting sights. I think it's the ideal place to stay, whether you're in town for sightseeing, shopping or business.

Visited Egerton House during a birthday weekend in London for my wife's birthday. I was looking for luxury and attentive service and did not want to go for one of the larger hotels. Egerton House fitted the bill perfectly. From the moment you walk in you are treated to personable and professional service. Every single member of the team we engaged with was superb. Special mention to Antonio in the bar - get him to share a few of his old stories over a cocktail or two. Location is central (2 mins walk to V&A and Harrods) but tucked away off the Main Street. Rooms are not huge but luxuriously decorated. If you are looking for exemplary service in a friendly and intimate surrounding I highly recommend Egerton House.

Fab experience staying just blocks away from South Kensington Tube, museums, famous shopping districts, you are welcomed by a caring staff and gorgeous rooms. Op for English Breakfast to provide daily energy choices- helps fuel your London travel journeys. Egerton has easy access via Heathrow Express / Paddington Station, then take London's famous "black" taxi to hotel through Hyde Park. Hope to stay again in the near future!

The Egerton House Hotel was like my home away from home. They staff made the stay so welcoming and personal. I would go back to this hotel tomorrow if I could! My husband and I walked to Buckingham Palace, to Parliament, to a spot on the corner by Big Ben to watch the Tour de France, shopping at Harrods and so much more. We visited a few restaurants on the way home or on the way out in the morning had a lovely breakfast in the dining room. There are also parks along the way to enjoy. A must stay place for anyone traveling to London!

I have been in the hotel this August. It was a really wonderful staff memorable experience with excellent cleaning and exquisite service. excellent food. repeat finding insurance. a quiet yet very close to all landmarks london hotel. Room Tip: my room was 34 i a really lovely room See more room tips

My family's stay at the Egerton was absolutely fabulous. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left they provided us wonderful customer service. The amenities in the room and in the hotel were beyond extraordinary. If you are an American I will warn you that the rooms are much smaller than you might be used to in American hotels, but please do not let that prevent you from staying here. While our room was a bit close (2 tall adults with two large suitcases and two carryons) we still had a good deal of room and felt very comfortable. The bed was truly the best bed I'd slept on at any hotel I've stayed in around the world. I would thoroughly recommend the Egerton to anyone coming to London. It is also EXTREMELY conveniently located to Tube stops, Harrods, the Victoria and Albert Museum and other wonderful monuments.

It was a great pleasure to stay at the Egerton House Hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our stay did feel like home. The hotel is cosy and offers a lot of special services. Another important reason to stay, the Hotel is situated in a beautiful location as well, near Harrods and other famous sights. We will recommend this Hotel to other visitors!

The physical plant of this hotel is nice enough and the location fine. However, the extremely helpful and attentive staff make this hotel shine. I generally prefer to be left alone while traveling but these folks make their interaction with and assistance to guests effortless (for the guest) without being cloying or obsequient. Because of them this is a wonderful place to stay.

My husband and I walked to Buckingham Palace, to Parliament, to a spot on the corner by Big Ben to watch the Tour de France, shopping at Harrods and so much more. We visited a few restaurants on the way home or on the way out in the morning had a lovely breakfast in the dining room. There are also parks along the way to enjoy. A must stay place for anyone traveling to London!

I have been in the hotel this August. It was a really wonderful staff memorable experience with excellent cleaning and exquisite service. excellent food. repeat finding insurance. a quiet yet very close to all landmarks london hotel.

My family's stay at the Egerton was absolutely fabulous. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left they provided us wonderful customer service. The amenities in the room and in the hotel were beyond extraordinary. If you are an American I will warn you that the rooms are much smaller than you might be used to in American hotels, but please do not let that prevent you from staying here. While our room was a bit close (2 tall adults with two large suitcases and two carryons) we still had a good deal of room and felt very comfortable. The bed was truly the best bed I'd slept on at any hotel I've stayed in around the world. I would thoroughly recommend the Egerton to anyone coming to London. It is also EXTREMELY conveniently located to Tube stops, Harrods, the Victoria and Albert Museum and other wonderful monuments.

It was a great pleasure to stay at the Egerton House Hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our stay did feel like home. The hotel is cosy and offers a lot of special services. Another important reason to stay, the Hotel is situated in a beautiful location as well, near Harrods and other famous sights. We will recommend this Hotel to other visitors!

The physical plant of this hotel is nice enough and the location fine. However, the extremely helpful and attentive staff make this hotel shine. I generally prefer to be left alone while traveling but these folks make their interaction with and assistance to guests effortless (for the guest) without being cloying or obsequient. Because of them this is a wonderful place to stay.

Dear Guest, Thank you so very much for taking the time to review the Egerton House Hotel on TripAdvisor. I am most proud of my team and it really is without them that nothing could be achieved and we wouldnât have the pleasure to read such wonderful reviews like yours. The staff are highly motivated by great service though with added sincerity. I believe this is what makes The Egerton House more of a home than a hotel and Iâm pleased that you felt extremely comfortable. . I very much look forward to welcoming you back on a future visit and thank you for staying with us. Warm wishes, Michelle Devlin General Manager

I,d been to The Egerton several times and each time I arrive , I feel at home. Once I arrive and somebody was waiting for me at The AirPort , this is to be pampered. Excelent driver, excelllent car. When you arrive The team working there is , all of them, helpful , nice and in good mood. The neighbourhood it's perfect, The museum, the park, Brompton Ave and Harrods nearby, and you have also the quiet streets and the small restaurants in the area make The Egerton your Home in London! You SHOULD go! Room Tip: View to the gardens See more room tips

Dear Guest, Thank you so very much for taking the time to share your experience of The Egerton House Hotel with other TripAdvisor viewers. I am delighted to read of what a fantastic experience you had and I thank you for your compliments toward my team. They are motivated by providing excellent service and they shall be as happy as I am to read your review. Feedback from our guests is so incredibly important to us and yours is so very much appreciated. I very much look forward to welcoming you home once again; hopefully in the not too distant future.

Thank you for a most pleasurable time at the Egerton. Everyone was so nice and the room and service were excellent. We had a wonderful time in the bar with the guests and the opera singing was great. Our breakfast was wonderful. We truly had a wonderful time, even if it was just overnight. We will be back whenever we get back to London.

This hotel stands apart from the many anonymous hotel chains. The outstanding service is personal, with the staff willing to go out if their way to make your time in London special. They are highly knowledgeable on what's going on, what is worth seeing (and what isn't). Always ready to have a chat or offer a cup of tea. It really made us feel most welcome. The rooms are stylish yet comfortable to live in rather than just glamorous to look at. Each room is different. I don't think you can get a better location. 2 blocks from Harrods, a few minutes walk from Hyde park and some of the many museums and interesting sights. I think it's the ideal place to stay, whether you're in town for sightseeing, shopping or business.

Visited Egerton House during a birthday weekend in London for my wife's birthday. I was looking for luxury and attentive service and did not want to go for one of the larger hotels. Egerton House fitted the bill perfectly. From the moment you walk in you are treated to personable and professional service. Every single member of the team we engaged with was superb. Special mention to Antonio in the bar - get him to share a few of his old stories over a cocktail or two. Location is central (2 mins walk to V&A and Harrods) but tucked away off the Main Street. Rooms are not huge but luxuriously decorated. If you are looking for exemplary service in a friendly and intimate surrounding I highly recommend Egerton House.

Fab experience staying just blocks away from South Kensington Tube, museums, famous shopping districts, you are welcomed by a caring staff and gorgeous rooms. Op for English Breakfast to provide daily energy choices- helps fuel your London travel journeys. Egerton has easy access via Heathrow Express / Paddington Station, then take London's famous "black" taxi to hotel through Hyde Park. Hope to stay again in the near future!

Thank you for a most pleasurable time at the Egerton. Everyone was so nice and the room and service were excellent. We had a wonderful time in the bar with the guests and the opera singing was great. Our breakfast was wonderful. We truly had a wonderful time, even if it was just overnight. We will be back whenever we get back to London.

This hotel stands apart from the many anonymous hotel chains. The outstanding service is personal, with the staff willing to go out if their way to make your time in London special. They are highly knowledgeable on what's going on, what is worth seeing (and what isn't). Always ready to have a chat or offer a cup of tea. It really made us feel most welcome. The rooms are stylish yet comfortable to live in rather than just glamorous to look at. Each room is different. I don't think you can get a better location. 2 blocks from Harrods, a few minutes walk from Hyde park and some of the many museums and interesting sights. I think it's the ideal place to stay, whether you're in town for sightseeing, shopping or business.

Visited Egerton House during a birthday weekend in London for my wife's birthday. I was looking for luxury and attentive service and did not want to go for one of the larger hotels. Egerton House fitted the bill perfectly. From the moment you walk in you are treated to personable and professional service. Every single member of the team we engaged with was superb. Special mention to Antonio in the bar - get him to share a few of his old stories over a cocktail or two. Location is central (2 mins walk to V&A and Harrods) but tucked away off the Main Street. Rooms are not huge but luxuriously decorated. If you are looking for exemplary service in a friendly and intimate surrounding I highly recommend Egerton House.

Fab experience staying just blocks away from South Kensington Tube, museums, famous shopping districts, you are welcomed by a caring staff and gorgeous rooms. Op for English Breakfast to provide daily energy choices- helps fuel your London travel journeys. Egerton has easy access via Heathrow Express / Paddington Station, then take London's famous "black" taxi to hotel through Hyde Park. Hope to stay again in the near future!

The Egerton House Hotel was like my home away from home. They staff made the stay so welcoming and personal. I would go back to this hotel tomorrow if I could! My husband and I walked to Buckingham Palace, to Parliament, to a spot on the corner by Big Ben to watch the Tour de France, shopping at Harrods and so much more. We visited a few restaurants on the way home or on the way out in the morning had a lovely breakfast in the dining room. There are also parks along the way to enjoy. A must stay place for anyone traveling to London!

I have been in the hotel this August. It was a really wonderful staff memorable experience with excellent cleaning and exquisite service. excellent food. repeat finding insurance. a quiet yet very close to all landmarks london hotel. Room Tip: my room was 34 i a really lovely room See more room tips

My family's stay at the Egerton was absolutely fabulous. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left they provided us wonderful customer service. The amenities in the room and in the hotel were beyond extraordinary. If you are an American I will warn you that the rooms are much smaller than you might be used to in American hotels, but please do not let that prevent you from staying here. While our room was a bit close (2 tall adults with two large suitcases and two carryons) we still had a good deal of room and felt very comfortable. The bed was truly the best bed I'd slept on at any hotel I've stayed in around the world. I would thoroughly recommend the Egerton to anyone coming to London. It is also EXTREMELY conveniently located to Tube stops, Harrods, the Victoria and Albert Museum and other wonderful monuments.

It was a great pleasure to stay at the Egerton House Hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our stay did feel like home. The hotel is cosy and offers a lot of special services. Another important reason to stay, the Hotel is situated in a beautiful location as well, near Harrods and other famous sights. We will recommend this Hotel to other visitors!

The physical plant of this hotel is nice enough and the location fine. However, the extremely helpful and attentive staff make this hotel shine. I generally prefer to be left alone while traveling but these folks make their interaction with and assistance to guests effortless (for the guest) without being cloying or obsequient. Because of them this is a wonderful place to stay.

Dear Guest, Thank you so very much for taking the time to review the Egerton House Hotel on TripAdvisor. I am most proud of my team and it really is without them that nothing could be achieved and we wouldnât have the pleasure to read such wonderful reviews like yours. The staff are highly motivated by great service though with added sincerity. I believe this is what makes The Egerton House more of a home than a hotel and Iâm pleased that you felt extremely comfortable. . I very much look forward to welcoming you back on a future visit and thank you for staying with us. Warm wishes, Michelle Devlin General Manager

I,d been to The Egerton several times and each time I arrive , I feel at home. Once I arrive and somebody was waiting for me at The AirPort , this is to be pampered. Excelent driver, excelllent car. When you arrive The team working there is , all of them, helpful , nice and in good mood. The neighbourhood it's perfect, The museum, the park, Brompton Ave and Harrods nearby, and you have also the quiet streets and the small restaurants in the area make The Egerton your Home in London! You SHOULD go! Room Tip: View to the gardens See more room tips

The bed was truly the best bed I'd slept on at any hotel I've stayed in around the world. I would thoroughly recommend the Egerton to anyone coming to London. It is also EXTREMELY conveniently located to Tube stops, Harrods, the Victoria and Albert Museum and other wonderful monuments.

It was a great pleasure to stay at the Egerton House Hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our stay did feel like home. The hotel is cosy and offers a lot of special services. Another important reason to stay, the Hotel is situated in a beautiful location as well, near Harrods and other famous sights. We will recommend this Hotel to other visitors!

The physical plant of this hotel is nice enough and the location fine. However, the extremely helpful and attentive staff make this hotel shine. I generally prefer to be left alone while traveling but these folks make their interaction with and assistance to guests effortless (for the guest) without being cloying or obsequient. Because of them this is a wonderful place to stay.

Dear Guest, Thank you so very much for taking the time to review the Egerton House Hotel on TripAdvisor.

The staff are highly motivated by great service though with added sincerity. I believe this is what makes The Egerton House more of a home than a hotel and Iâm pleased that you felt extremely comfortable. . I very much look forward to welcoming you back on a future visit and thank you for staying with us. Warm wishes, Michelle Devlin General Manager

I,d been to The Egerton several times and each time I arrive , I feel at home. Once I arrive and somebody was waiting for me at The AirPort , this is to be pampered. Excelent driver, excelllent car. When you arrive The team working there is , all of them, helpful , nice and in good mood. The neighbourhood it's perfect, The museum, the park, Brompton Ave and Harrods nearby, and you have also the quiet streets and the small restaurants in the area make The Egerton your Home in London! You SHOULD go! Room Tip: View to the gardens See more room tips

Thank you for a most pleasurable time at the Egerton. Everyone was so nice and the room and service were excellent. We had a wonderful time in the bar with the guests and the opera singing was great. Our breakfast was wonderful. We truly had a wonderful time, even if it was just overnight. We will be back whenever we get back to London.

This hotel stands apart from the many anonymous hotel chains. The outstanding service is personal, with the staff willing to go out if their way to make your time in London special. They are highly knowledgeable on what's going on, what is worth seeing (and what isn't). Always ready to have a chat or offer a cup of tea. It really made us feel most welcome. The rooms are stylish yet comfortable to live in rather than just glamorous to look at. Each room is different. I don't think you can get a better location. 2 blocks from Harrods, a few minutes walk from Hyde park and some of the many museums and interesting sights. I think it's the ideal place to stay, whether you're in town for sightseeing, shopping or business.

Visited Egerton House during a birthday weekend in London for my wife's birthday. I was looking for luxury and attentive service and did not want to go for one of the larger hotels. Egerton House fitted the bill perfectly. From the moment you walk in you are treated to personable and professional service. Every single member of the team we engaged with was superb. Special mention to Antonio in the bar - get him to share a few of his old stories over a cocktail or two. Location is central (2 mins walk to V&A and Harrods) but tucked away off the Main Street. Rooms are not huge but luxuriously decorated. If you are looking for exemplary service in a friendly and intimate surrounding I highly recommend Egerton House.

Fab experience staying just blocks away from South Kensington Tube, museums, famous shopping districts, you are welcomed by a caring staff and gorgeous rooms. Op for English Breakfast to provide daily energy choices- helps fuel your London travel journeys. Egerton has easy access via Heathrow Express / Paddington Station, then take London's famous "black" taxi to hotel through Hyde Park. Hope to stay again in the near future!

The Egerton House Hotel was like my home away from home. They staff made the stay so welcoming and personal. I would go back to this hotel tomorrow if I could! My husband and I walked to Buckingham Palace, to Parliament, to a spot on the corner by Big Ben to watch the Tour de France, shopping at Harrods and so much more. We visited a few restaurants on the way home or on the way out in the morning had a lovely breakfast in the dining room. There are also parks along the way to enjoy. A must stay place for anyone traveling to London!

My family's stay at the Egerton was absolutely fabulous. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left they provided us wonderful customer service.
