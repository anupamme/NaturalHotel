We arrived, for our three night stay, after an early flight to drop our bags and received the usual warm welcome and offer of complimentary drinks. The good news was the room was available for an early check-in. The hotel has a modern look and feel, but it has a calm atmosphere. The location is perfectly quiet and thatâs why we choose to return. The transport links are good; a few minuteâs walk from Hyde Park Corner for buses and tube. Please be aware that Hyde Park Corner tube station doesn't have a down escalator nor does it have a lift. There are only stairs available until the elevator renavation is completed. The rooms are a good size and very comfortable. There is a large double bed, two arm chairs with a small table and a desk. The bathroom feels large with a bath and shower. At each side of the bed there are gadgets to control the lights, air conditioning and other essentials. The bed is really comfortable. As time is always short in London we havenât tried the restaurant for breakfast or dinner. We checked out and left the luggage to collect later. On departure, as the weather was wet and the extra case was heavy with shopping, we decided to get a car to the airport. The concierge arranged this at short notice and in no time we were on our way. This is a very nice hotel with very professional staff and we will certainly return again.

Dear threehens Thank you for your lovely review. So pleased you had such a great stay and i do hope we can welcome you back soon. Just to clarify for other readers we are not under any refurbishment and the lifts are working perfectly. I think threehens stayed whilst the lifts were having their regular safety inspection and hence one was closed for a short period of time during the day. Best regards Simon

We really couldn't fault this amazing hotel with it's efficient and friendly staff, clean and comfortable room and peaceful position. The Halkin is an oasis in the midst of a bustling part of London, within walking distance of Piccadilly,Green Park and Buckingham Palace. . The attention to detail in our room and the first class attentive staff made our stay very memorable. We have no hesitation in recommending The Halkin by Como.

Thank you Christine Your review is much appreciated and i do hope we will see you again soon. Christmas shopping is always a good time to have some relaxation after a hard day at the shops. Best Regards Simon

We booked this hotel based on prior trip advisor reviews and are so happy we did. First of all, the service is amazing. The staff is always happy to help with any question and ready with a friendly smile if you are just passing through the lobby. Every suggestion they made, for dining or the best way to travel, was spot-on. We were in town to play tourist. The hotel is located near the Hyde Park Corner Underground station, but we found we almost never used the Underground to get anywhere. We could easily walk to Westminster Abbey, Victoria, Buckingham Palace, and Hyde Park. Then, because of the hotel's central location, it was often just as easy to grab a cab to where we needed to go. But when we did take the Underground, it was a quick walk to the station. I really can't recommend this hotel enough!

Dear Joey B Thank you for your lovely review and highlighting the service as well as our great location. Do please let me know when your next planning to visit so we can welcome you home. Best Regards Simon

Hotel is new and sleek with a terrific staff that accommodates every request. Hotel is located on a quiet street which is amazing and win the Mayfair district so everything is walkable including Buckingham palace) I will certainly return and will only stay here. I stayed here twice in August 2014. the BEST location in London. Room Tip: from Heathrow.... take the Heathrow express and to Paddington and taxi to hotel (30 mins to hotel) See more room tips

Dear kgera Thank you for staying with us twice in August and also for your great tip. just to clarify the taxi ride should only take 10 mins from Paddington so the whole journey from Heathrow about 30 mins. I see you live in Miami so you must try out our new hotel Metropolitan by COMO , Miami beach and tell Javier I recommended you ! Best Regards Simon

My husband and I have just returned from a 3 night stay at The Halkin. We chose this hotel as we had previously stayed in another Como Group hotel on our honeymoon. The hotel is a boutique hotel, located in a quiet street in Belgravia. We didn't hear any road noise at all. It was a perfect base for our trip, very close to Hyde Park Corner tube stop and walking distance to a lot of sights. We stayed in a deluxe room, number 209. The room was large and immaculately clean. It had a king sized bed, large tv, seating area and a huge wardrobe space. The room had black out blinds/curtains which made for a perfect night sleep. When staying at hotels we try to make the most of the services that hotel offers. We ate breakfast in Ametsa restaurant, had drinks in the hotel bar and ate from room service. All of the food was immaculately presented and the room service arrived quickly and was piping hot. The staff at the hotel were all very friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back to stay at this hotel on our next trip to London.

Dear touristgirl86 Thank you for taking the time to write a review and also for staying at our sister COMO hotels. Do let me know if you are planning to visit us or one of the other 11 hotels again soon. Best Regards Simon

If you like me prefer elegant, well kept and "not too busy" hotel this is the best London has to offer. The rooms are very spatious, nicely decorated and the service great. Location is perfect (right into Belgravia beside Green Park) for a leisure/shopping trip to London. I often spend a weekend in London and when I do I always stay at the Halkin. Highly recommended!

Dear Theo Thank you for your great review highlighting the rooms, service and great location. Zurich is very close so do come for more weekends !! Best Regards Simon

Staying at Halkin, one can be as private as you wish. One can enter lobby and be up in your spacious room with no fuss. Great bathrooms with incredible showers. Really likes the express breakfast- delivered very promptly and at a sensible price. Room service for drinks and wine also delivered very quickly. Bar area a little sterile but friendly, attentive staff do as best they can to make up for its shortfalls. Have stayed here many times, love the location.

Dear Matt Thank you for the great review and summing up The Halkin so well. Best Regards Simon

Peace and quite in the heart of London?. Yes, it's possible. Just make your next stay in London at the Halkin. My wife and I enjoy the buzz of a big city, but when we switch off we like to leave it behind. And in this little corner of Belgravia you certainly can. Great sized room, we took a Deluxe. Bathroom, very adequate even to accommodate my wife's abilities to clutter even the smallest of extremities. And did I mention that it was quiet! Staff were exceptional from the front desk, to the excellent concierge staff. All your recommendations were much appreciated, thank you. location, near perfect, literally in Buckingham Palace's back garden. Very short walk to Hyde Park, for that morning jog. And an easy walk to Harrods, although not back, with all those bags! Breakfast was great , along with the service. A small, boutique hotel, with warmth and, did I mention quiet? Happily recommend the Halkin. Room Tip: Deluxe room was a comfortable size See more room tips

Dear Adrian Thank you so much for your wonderful review. Soo quiet indeed even when we are in central London. I do hope you managed to get all the shopping bags back to Australia ! Best Regards Simon

The Halkin is a fairly small hotel located in a quiet side street in Belgravia. Staff were very efficient and helpful during check-in and throughout our short stay. The rooms were extremely comfortable and well-equipped, with good beds, efficient air conditioning and well-equipped (and fairly large) bathrooms. This was our first stay, but I would certainly recommend for those looking for an alternative to London's larger/grander hotels.

Dear ChipL-67 Thank you for your top marks review of the hotel and we look forward to welcoming you back soon Best Regards Simon

Stayed with my family and we enjoyed ever bit of the hotel. Small and very classy hotel. Centrally located but on a quiet street. Modern and comfortable rooms, with very friendly and helpful hotel staff. A really outstanding hotel.

On departure, as the weather was wet and the extra case was heavy with shopping, we decided to get a car to the airport. The concierge arranged this at short notice and in no time we were on our way. This is a very nice hotel with very professional staff and we will certainly return again.

Dear threehens Thank you for your lovely review. So pleased you had such a great stay and i do hope we can welcome you back soon. Just to clarify for other readers we are not under any refurbishment and the lifts are working perfectly. I think threehens stayed whilst the lifts were having their regular safety inspection and hence one was closed for a short period of time during the day. Best regards Simon

We really couldn't fault this amazing hotel with it's efficient and friendly staff, clean and comfortable room and peaceful position. The Halkin is an oasis in the midst of a bustling part of London, within walking distance of Piccadilly,Green Park and Buckingham Palace. . The attention to detail in our room and the first class attentive staff made our stay very memorable. We have no hesitation in recommending The Halkin by Como.

Thank you Christine Your review is much appreciated and i do hope we will see you again soon. Christmas shopping is always a good time to have some relaxation after a hard day at the shops. Best Regards Simon

We booked this hotel based on prior trip advisor reviews and are so happy we did. First of all, the service is amazing. The staff is always happy to help with any question and ready with a friendly smile if you are just passing through the lobby. Every suggestion they made, for dining or the best way to travel, was spot-on. We were in town to play tourist. The hotel is located near the Hyde Park Corner Underground station, but we found we almost never used the Underground to get anywhere. We could easily walk to Westminster Abbey, Victoria, Buckingham Palace, and Hyde Park. Then, because of the hotel's central location, it was often just as easy to grab a cab to where we needed to go. But when we did take the Underground, it was a quick walk to the station. I really can't recommend this hotel enough!

Dear Joey B Thank you for your lovely review and highlighting the service as well as our great location. Do please let me know when your next planning to visit so we can welcome you home. Best Regards Simon

Hotel is new and sleek with a terrific staff that accommodates every request. Hotel is located on a quiet street which is amazing and win the Mayfair district so everything is walkable including Buckingham palace) I will certainly return and will only stay here. I stayed here twice in August 2014. the BEST location in London. Room Tip: from Heathrow.... take the Heathrow express and to Paddington and taxi to hotel (30 mins to hotel) See more room tips

Dear kgera Thank you for staying with us twice in August and also for your great tip. just to clarify the taxi ride should only take 10 mins from Paddington so the whole journey from Heathrow about 30 mins. I see you live in Miami so you must try out our new hotel Metropolitan by COMO , Miami beach and tell Javier I recommended you ! Best Regards Simon

My husband and I have just returned from a 3 night stay at The Halkin. We chose this hotel as we had previously stayed in another Como Group hotel on our honeymoon. The hotel is a boutique hotel, located in a quiet street in Belgravia. We didn't hear any road noise at all. It was a perfect base for our trip, very close to Hyde Park Corner tube stop and walking distance to a lot of sights. We stayed in a deluxe room, number 209. The room was large and immaculately clean. It had a king sized bed, large tv, seating area and a huge wardrobe space. The room had black out blinds/curtains which made for a perfect night sleep. When staying at hotels we try to make the most of the services that hotel offers. We ate breakfast in Ametsa restaurant, had drinks in the hotel bar and ate from room service. All of the food was immaculately presented and the room service arrived quickly and was piping hot. The staff at the hotel were all very friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back to stay at this hotel on our next trip to London.

Dear touristgirl86 Thank you for taking the time to write a review and also for staying at our sister COMO hotels. Do let me know if you are planning to visit us or one of the other 11 hotels again soon. Best Regards Simon

If you like me prefer elegant, well kept and "not too busy" hotel this is the best London has to offer. The rooms are very spatious, nicely decorated and the service great. Location is perfect (right into Belgravia beside Green Park) for a leisure/shopping trip to London. I often spend a weekend in London and when I do I always stay at the Halkin. Highly recommended!

Dear Theo Thank you for your great review highlighting the rooms, service and great location. Zurich is very close so do come for more weekends !! Best Regards Simon

Staying at Halkin, one can be as private as you wish. One can enter lobby and be up in your spacious room with no fuss. Great bathrooms with incredible showers. Really likes the express breakfast- delivered very promptly and at a sensible price. Room service for drinks and wine also delivered very quickly. Bar area a little sterile but friendly, attentive staff do as best they can to make up for its shortfalls. Have stayed here many times, love the location.

Dear Matt Thank you for the great review and summing up The Halkin so well. Best Regards Simon

Peace and quite in the heart of London?. Yes, it's possible. Just make your next stay in London at the Halkin. My wife and I enjoy the buzz of a big city, but when we switch off we like to leave it behind. And in this little corner of Belgravia you certainly can. Great sized room, we took a Deluxe. Bathroom, very adequate even to accommodate my wife's abilities to clutter even the smallest of extremities. And did I mention that it was quiet! Staff were exceptional from the front desk, to the excellent concierge staff. All your recommendations were much appreciated, thank you. location, near perfect, literally in Buckingham Palace's back garden. Very short walk to Hyde Park, for that morning jog. And an easy walk to Harrods, although not back, with all those bags! Breakfast was great , along with the service. A small, boutique hotel, with warmth and, did I mention quiet? Happily recommend the Halkin. Room Tip: Deluxe room was a comfortable size See more room tips

Dear Adrian Thank you so much for your wonderful review. Soo quiet indeed even when we are in central London. I do hope you managed to get all the shopping bags back to Australia ! Best Regards Simon

The Halkin is a fairly small hotel located in a quiet side street in Belgravia. Staff were very efficient and helpful during check-in and throughout our short stay. The rooms were extremely comfortable and well-equipped, with good beds, efficient air conditioning and well-equipped (and fairly large) bathrooms. This was our first stay, but I would certainly recommend for those looking for an alternative to London's larger/grander hotels.

Dear ChipL-67 Thank you for your top marks review of the hotel and we look forward to welcoming you back soon Best Regards Simon

Stayed with my family and we enjoyed ever bit of the hotel. Small and very classy hotel. Centrally located but on a quiet street. Modern and comfortable rooms, with very friendly and helpful hotel staff. A really outstanding hotel.

Dear ChipL-67 Thank you for your "classy" review of The Halkin. so pleased that your family had a great stay. Do come and visit us again soon. Best Regards Simon

We arrived, for our three night stay, after an early flight to drop our bags and received the usual warm welcome and offer of complimentary drinks. The good news was the room was available for an early check-in. The hotel has a modern look and feel, but it has a calm atmosphere. The location is perfectly quiet and thatâs why we choose to return. The transport links are good; a few minuteâs walk from Hyde Park Corner for buses and tube. Please be aware that Hyde Park Corner tube station doesn't have a down escalator nor does it have a lift. There are only stairs available until the elevator renavation is completed. The rooms are a good size and very comfortable. There is a large double bed, two arm chairs with a small table and a desk. The bathroom feels large with a bath and shower. At each side of the bed there are gadgets to control the lights, air conditioning and other essentials. The bed is really comfortable.

The attention to detail in our room and the first class attentive staff made our stay very memorable. We have no hesitation in recommending The Halkin by Como.

Thank you Christine Your review is much appreciated and i do hope we will see you again soon. Christmas shopping is always a good time to have some relaxation after a hard day at the shops. Best Regards Simon

We booked this hotel based on prior trip advisor reviews and are so happy we did. First of all, the service is amazing. The staff is always happy to help with any question and ready with a friendly smile if you are just passing through the lobby. Every suggestion they made, for dining or the best way to travel, was spot-on. We were in town to play tourist. The hotel is located near the Hyde Park Corner Underground station, but we found we almost never used the Underground to get anywhere. We could easily walk to Westminster Abbey, Victoria, Buckingham Palace, and Hyde Park. Then, because of the hotel's central location, it was often just as easy to grab a cab to where we needed to go. But when we did take the Underground, it was a quick walk to the station. I really can't recommend this hotel enough!

Dear Joey B Thank you for your lovely review and highlighting the service as well as our great location. Do please let me know when your next planning to visit so we can welcome you home. Best Regards Simon

Hotel is new and sleek with a terrific staff that accommodates every request. Hotel is located on a quiet street which is amazing and win the Mayfair district so everything is walkable including Buckingham palace) I will certainly return and will only stay here. I stayed here twice in August 2014. the BEST location in London. Room Tip: from Heathrow.... take the Heathrow express and to Paddington and taxi to hotel (30 mins to hotel) See more room tips

Dear kgera Thank you for staying with us twice in August and also for your great tip. just to clarify the taxi ride should only take 10 mins from Paddington so the whole journey from Heathrow about 30 mins. I see you live in Miami so you must try out our new hotel Metropolitan by COMO , Miami beach and tell Javier I recommended you ! Best Regards Simon

My husband and I have just returned from a 3 night stay at The Halkin. We chose this hotel as we had previously stayed in another Como Group hotel on our honeymoon. The hotel is a boutique hotel, located in a quiet street in Belgravia. We didn't hear any road noise at all. It was a perfect base for our trip, very close to Hyde Park Corner tube stop and walking distance to a lot of sights. We stayed in a deluxe room, number 209. The room was large and immaculately clean. It had a king sized bed, large tv, seating area and a huge wardrobe space. The room had black out blinds/curtains which made for a perfect night sleep. When staying at hotels we try to make the most of the services that hotel offers. We ate breakfast in Ametsa restaurant, had drinks in the hotel bar and ate from room service. All of the food was immaculately presented and the room service arrived quickly and was piping hot. The staff at the hotel were all very friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back to stay at this hotel on our next trip to London.

Dear touristgirl86 Thank you for taking the time to write a review and also for staying at our sister COMO hotels. Do let me know if you are planning to visit us or one of the other 11 hotels again soon. Best Regards Simon

If you like me prefer elegant, well kept and "not too busy" hotel this is the best London has to offer. The rooms are very spatious, nicely decorated and the service great. Location is perfect (right into Belgravia beside Green Park) for a leisure/shopping trip to London. I often spend a weekend in London and when I do I always stay at the Halkin. Highly recommended!

Dear Theo Thank you for your great review highlighting the rooms, service and great location. Zurich is very close so do come for more weekends !! Best Regards Simon

Staying at Halkin, one can be as private as you wish. One can enter lobby and be up in your spacious room with no fuss. Great bathrooms with incredible showers. Really likes the express breakfast- delivered very promptly and at a sensible price. Room service for drinks and wine also delivered very quickly. Bar area a little sterile but friendly, attentive staff do as best they can to make up for its shortfalls. Have stayed here many times, love the location.

Dear Matt Thank you for the great review and summing up The Halkin so well. Best Regards Simon

Peace and quite in the heart of London?. Yes, it's possible. Just make your next stay in London at the Halkin. My wife and I enjoy the buzz of a big city, but when we switch off we like to leave it behind. And in this little corner of Belgravia you certainly can. Great sized room, we took a Deluxe. Bathroom, very adequate even to accommodate my wife's abilities to clutter even the smallest of extremities. And did I mention that it was quiet! Staff were exceptional from the front desk, to the excellent concierge staff. All your recommendations were much appreciated, thank you. location, near perfect, literally in Buckingham Palace's back garden. Very short walk to Hyde Park, for that morning jog. And an easy walk to Harrods, although not back, with all those bags! Breakfast was great , along with the service. A small, boutique hotel, with warmth and, did I mention quiet? Happily recommend the Halkin. Room Tip: Deluxe room was a comfortable size See more room tips

Dear Adrian Thank you so much for your wonderful review. Soo quiet indeed even when we are in central London. I do hope you managed to get all the shopping bags back to Australia ! Best Regards Simon

The Halkin is a fairly small hotel located in a quiet side street in Belgravia. Staff were very efficient and helpful during check-in and throughout our short stay. The rooms were extremely comfortable and well-equipped, with good beds, efficient air conditioning and well-equipped (and fairly large) bathrooms. This was our first stay, but I would certainly recommend for those looking for an alternative to London's larger/grander hotels.

Dear ChipL-67 Thank you for your top marks review of the hotel and we look forward to welcoming you back soon Best Regards Simon

Stayed with my family and we enjoyed ever bit of the hotel. Small and very classy hotel. Centrally located but on a quiet street. Modern and comfortable rooms, with very friendly and helpful hotel staff. A really outstanding hotel.

Dear ChipL-67 Thank you for your "classy" review of The Halkin. so pleased that your family had a great stay. Do come and visit us again soon. Best Regards Simon

We arrived, for our three night stay, after an early flight to drop our bags and received the usual warm welcome and offer of complimentary drinks. The good news was the room was available for an early check-in. The hotel has a modern look and feel, but it has a calm atmosphere. The location is perfectly quiet and thatâs why we choose to return. The transport links are good; a few minuteâs walk from Hyde Park Corner for buses and tube. Please be aware that Hyde Park Corner tube station doesn't have a down escalator nor does it have a lift. There are only stairs available until the elevator renavation is completed. The rooms are a good size and very comfortable. There is a large double bed, two arm chairs with a small table and a desk. The bathroom feels large with a bath and shower. At each side of the bed there are gadgets to control the lights, air conditioning and other essentials. The bed is really comfortable. As time is always short in London we havenât tried the restaurant for breakfast or dinner. We checked out and left the luggage to collect later. On departure, as the weather was wet and the extra case was heavy with shopping, we decided to get a car to the airport. The concierge arranged this at short notice and in no time we were on our way. This is a very nice hotel with very professional staff and we will certainly return again.

Dear threehens Thank you for your lovely review. So pleased you had such a great stay and i do hope we can welcome you back soon. Just to clarify for other readers we are not under any refurbishment and the lifts are working perfectly. I think threehens stayed whilst the lifts were having their regular safety inspection and hence one was closed for a short period of time during the day. Best regards Simon

We could easily walk to Westminster Abbey, Victoria, Buckingham Palace, and Hyde Park. Then, because of the hotel's central location, it was often just as easy to grab a cab to where we needed to go. But when we did take the Underground, it was a quick walk to the station. I really can't recommend this hotel enough!

Dear Joey B Thank you for your lovely review and highlighting the service as well as our great location. Do please let me know when your next planning to visit so we can welcome you home. Best Regards Simon

Hotel is new and sleek with a terrific staff that accommodates every request. Hotel is located on a quiet street which is amazing and win the Mayfair district so everything is walkable including Buckingham palace) I will certainly return and will only stay here. I stayed here twice in August 2014. the BEST location in London. Room Tip: from Heathrow.... take the Heathrow express and to Paddington and taxi to hotel (30 mins to hotel) See more room tips

Dear kgera Thank you for staying with us twice in August and also for your great tip. just to clarify the taxi ride should only take 10 mins from Paddington so the whole journey from Heathrow about 30 mins. I see you live in Miami so you must try out our new hotel Metropolitan by COMO , Miami beach and tell Javier I recommended you ! Best Regards Simon

My husband and I have just returned from a 3 night stay at The Halkin. We chose this hotel as we had previously stayed in another Como Group hotel on our honeymoon. The hotel is a boutique hotel, located in a quiet street in Belgravia. We didn't hear any road noise at all. It was a perfect base for our trip, very close to Hyde Park Corner tube stop and walking distance to a lot of sights. We stayed in a deluxe room, number 209. The room was large and immaculately clean. It had a king sized bed, large tv, seating area and a huge wardrobe space. The room had black out blinds/curtains which made for a perfect night sleep. When staying at hotels we try to make the most of the services that hotel offers. We ate breakfast in Ametsa restaurant, had drinks in the hotel bar and ate from room service. All of the food was immaculately presented and the room service arrived quickly and was piping hot. The staff at the hotel were all very friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back to stay at this hotel on our next trip to London.

Dear touristgirl86 Thank you for taking the time to write a review and also for staying at our sister COMO hotels. Do let me know if you are planning to visit us or one of the other 11 hotels again soon. Best Regards Simon

If you like me prefer elegant, well kept and "not too busy" hotel this is the best London has to offer. The rooms are very spatious, nicely decorated and the service great. Location is perfect (right into Belgravia beside Green Park) for a leisure/shopping trip to London. I often spend a weekend in London and when I do I always stay at the Halkin. Highly recommended!

Dear Theo Thank you for your great review highlighting the rooms, service and great location. Zurich is very close so do come for more weekends !! Best Regards Simon

Staying at Halkin, one can be as private as you wish. One can enter lobby and be up in your spacious room with no fuss. Great bathrooms with incredible showers. Really likes the express breakfast- delivered very promptly and at a sensible price. Room service for drinks and wine also delivered very quickly. Bar area a little sterile but friendly, attentive staff do as best they can to make up for its shortfalls. Have stayed here many times, love the location.

Dear Matt Thank you for the great review and summing up The Halkin so well. Best Regards Simon

Peace and quite in the heart of London?. Yes, it's possible. Just make your next stay in London at the Halkin. My wife and I enjoy the buzz of a big city, but when we switch off we like to leave it behind. And in this little corner of Belgravia you certainly can. Great sized room, we took a Deluxe. Bathroom, very adequate even to accommodate my wife's abilities to clutter even the smallest of extremities. And did I mention that it was quiet! Staff were exceptional from the front desk, to the excellent concierge staff. All your recommendations were much appreciated, thank you. location, near perfect, literally in Buckingham Palace's back garden. Very short walk to Hyde Park, for that morning jog. And an easy walk to Harrods, although not back, with all those bags! Breakfast was great , along with the service. A small, boutique hotel, with warmth and, did I mention quiet? Happily recommend the Halkin. Room Tip: Deluxe room was a comfortable size See more room tips

Dear Adrian Thank you so much for your wonderful review. Soo quiet indeed even when we are in central London. I do hope you managed to get all the shopping bags back to Australia ! Best Regards Simon

The Halkin is a fairly small hotel located in a quiet side street in Belgravia. Staff were very efficient and helpful during check-in and throughout our short stay. The rooms were extremely comfortable and well-equipped, with good beds, efficient air conditioning and well-equipped (and fairly large) bathrooms. This was our first stay, but I would certainly recommend for those looking for an alternative to London's larger/grander hotels.

Dear ChipL-67 Thank you for your top marks review of the hotel and we look forward to welcoming you back soon Best Regards Simon

Stayed with my family and we enjoyed ever bit of the hotel. Small and very classy hotel. Centrally located but on a quiet street. Modern and comfortable rooms, with very friendly and helpful hotel staff. A really outstanding hotel.

Dear ChipL-67 Thank you for your "classy" review of The Halkin. so pleased that your family had a great stay. Do come and visit us again soon. Best Regards Simon

We arrived, for our three night stay, after an early flight to drop our bags and received the usual warm welcome and offer of complimentary drinks. The good news was the room was available for an early check-in. The hotel has a modern look and feel, but it has a calm atmosphere. The location is perfectly quiet and thatâs why we choose to return. The transport links are good; a few minuteâs walk from Hyde Park Corner for buses and tube. Please be aware that Hyde Park Corner tube station doesn't have a down escalator nor does it have a lift. There are only stairs available until the elevator renavation is completed. The rooms are a good size and very comfortable. There is a large double bed, two arm chairs with a small table and a desk. The bathroom feels large with a bath and shower. At each side of the bed there are gadgets to control the lights, air conditioning and other essentials. The bed is really comfortable. As time is always short in London we havenât tried the restaurant for breakfast or dinner. We checked out and left the luggage to collect later. On departure, as the weather was wet and the extra case was heavy with shopping, we decided to get a car to the airport. The concierge arranged this at short notice and in no time we were on our way. This is a very nice hotel with very professional staff and we will certainly return again.

Dear threehens Thank you for your lovely review. So pleased you had such a great stay and i do hope we can welcome you back soon. Just to clarify for other readers we are not under any refurbishment and the lifts are working perfectly. I think threehens stayed whilst the lifts were having their regular safety inspection and hence one was closed for a short period of time during the day. Best regards Simon

We really couldn't fault this amazing hotel with it's efficient and friendly staff, clean and comfortable room and peaceful position. The Halkin is an oasis in the midst of a bustling part of London, within walking distance of Piccadilly,Green Park and Buckingham Palace. . The attention to detail in our room and the first class attentive staff made our stay very memorable. We have no hesitation in recommending The Halkin by Como.

Thank you Christine Your review is much appreciated and i do hope we will see you again soon. Christmas shopping is always a good time to have some relaxation after a hard day at the shops. Best Regards Simon

We booked this hotel based on prior trip advisor reviews and are so happy we did. First of all, the service is amazing. The staff is always happy to help with any question and ready with a friendly smile if you are just passing through the lobby.

Dear kgera Thank you for staying with us twice in August and also for your great tip. just to clarify the taxi ride should only take 10 mins from Paddington so the whole journey from Heathrow about 30 mins. I see you live in Miami so you must try out our new hotel Metropolitan by COMO , Miami beach and tell Javier I recommended you ! Best Regards Simon

My husband and I have just returned from a 3 night stay at The Halkin. We chose this hotel as we had previously stayed in another Como Group hotel on our honeymoon. The hotel is a boutique hotel, located in a quiet street in Belgravia. We didn't hear any road noise at all. It was a perfect base for our trip, very close to Hyde Park Corner tube stop and walking distance to a lot of sights. We stayed in a deluxe room, number 209. The room was large and immaculately clean. It had a king sized bed, large tv, seating area and a huge wardrobe space. The room had black out blinds/curtains which made for a perfect night sleep. When staying at hotels we try to make the most of the services that hotel offers. We ate breakfast in Ametsa restaurant, had drinks in the hotel bar and ate from room service. All of the food was immaculately presented and the room service arrived quickly and was piping hot. The staff at the hotel were all very friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back to stay at this hotel on our next trip to London.

Dear touristgirl86 Thank you for taking the time to write a review and also for staying at our sister COMO hotels. Do let me know if you are planning to visit us or one of the other 11 hotels again soon. Best Regards Simon

If you like me prefer elegant, well kept and "not too busy" hotel this is the best London has to offer. The rooms are very spatious, nicely decorated and the service great. Location is perfect (right into Belgravia beside Green Park) for a leisure/shopping trip to London. I often spend a weekend in London and when I do I always stay at the Halkin. Highly recommended!

Dear Theo Thank you for your great review highlighting the rooms, service and great location. Zurich is very close so do come for more weekends !! Best Regards Simon

Staying at Halkin, one can be as private as you wish. One can enter lobby and be up in your spacious room with no fuss. Great bathrooms with incredible showers. Really likes the express breakfast- delivered very promptly and at a sensible price. Room service for drinks and wine also delivered very quickly. Bar area a little sterile but friendly, attentive staff do as best they can to make up for its shortfalls. Have stayed here many times, love the location.

Dear Matt Thank you for the great review and summing up The Halkin so well. Best Regards Simon

Peace and quite in the heart of London?. Yes, it's possible. Just make your next stay in London at the Halkin. My wife and I enjoy the buzz of a big city, but when we switch off we like to leave it behind. And in this little corner of Belgravia you certainly can. Great sized room, we took a Deluxe. Bathroom, very adequate even to accommodate my wife's abilities to clutter even the smallest of extremities. And did I mention that it was quiet! Staff were exceptional from the front desk, to the excellent concierge staff. All your recommendations were much appreciated, thank you. location, near perfect, literally in Buckingham Palace's back garden. Very short walk to Hyde Park, for that morning jog. And an easy walk to Harrods, although not back, with all those bags! Breakfast was great , along with the service. A small, boutique hotel, with warmth and, did I mention quiet? Happily recommend the Halkin. Room Tip: Deluxe room was a comfortable size See more room tips

Dear Adrian Thank you so much for your wonderful review. Soo quiet indeed even when we are in central London. I do hope you managed to get all the shopping bags back to Australia ! Best Regards Simon

The Halkin is a fairly small hotel located in a quiet side street in Belgravia. Staff were very efficient and helpful during check-in and throughout our short stay. The rooms were extremely comfortable and well-equipped, with good beds, efficient air conditioning and well-equipped (and fairly large) bathrooms. This was our first stay, but I would certainly recommend for those looking for an alternative to London's larger/grander hotels.

Dear ChipL-67 Thank you for your top marks review of the hotel and we look forward to welcoming you back soon Best Regards Simon

Stayed with my family and we enjoyed ever bit of the hotel. Small and very classy hotel. Centrally located but on a quiet street. Modern and comfortable rooms, with very friendly and helpful hotel staff. A really outstanding hotel.

Dear ChipL-67 Thank you for your "classy" review of The Halkin. so pleased that your family had a great stay. Do come and visit us again soon. Best Regards Simon

We arrived, for our three night stay, after an early flight to drop our bags and received the usual warm welcome and offer of complimentary drinks. The good news was the room was available for an early check-in. The hotel has a modern look and feel, but it has a calm atmosphere. The location is perfectly quiet and thatâs why we choose to return. The transport links are good; a few minuteâs walk from Hyde Park Corner for buses and tube. Please be aware that Hyde Park Corner tube station doesn't have a down escalator nor does it have a lift. There are only stairs available until the elevator renavation is completed. The rooms are a good size and very comfortable. There is a large double bed, two arm chairs with a small table and a desk. The bathroom feels large with a bath and shower. At each side of the bed there are gadgets to control the lights, air conditioning and other essentials. The bed is really comfortable. As time is always short in London we havenât tried the restaurant for breakfast or dinner. We checked out and left the luggage to collect later. On departure, as the weather was wet and the extra case was heavy with shopping, we decided to get a car to the airport. The concierge arranged this at short notice and in no time we were on our way. This is a very nice hotel with very professional staff and we will certainly return again.

Dear threehens Thank you for your lovely review. So pleased you had such a great stay and i do hope we can welcome you back soon. Just to clarify for other readers we are not under any refurbishment and the lifts are working perfectly. I think threehens stayed whilst the lifts were having their regular safety inspection and hence one was closed for a short period of time during the day. Best regards Simon

We really couldn't fault this amazing hotel with it's efficient and friendly staff, clean and comfortable room and peaceful position. The Halkin is an oasis in the midst of a bustling part of London, within walking distance of Piccadilly,Green Park and Buckingham Palace. . The attention to detail in our room and the first class attentive staff made our stay very memorable. We have no hesitation in recommending The Halkin by Como.

Thank you Christine Your review is much appreciated and i do hope we will see you again soon. Christmas shopping is always a good time to have some relaxation after a hard day at the shops. Best Regards Simon

We booked this hotel based on prior trip advisor reviews and are so happy we did. First of all, the service is amazing. The staff is always happy to help with any question and ready with a friendly smile if you are just passing through the lobby. Every suggestion they made, for dining or the best way to travel, was spot-on. We were in town to play tourist. The hotel is located near the Hyde Park Corner Underground station, but we found we almost never used the Underground to get anywhere. We could easily walk to Westminster Abbey, Victoria, Buckingham Palace, and Hyde Park. Then, because of the hotel's central location, it was often just as easy to grab a cab to where we needed to go. But when we did take the Underground, it was a quick walk to the station. I really can't recommend this hotel enough!

Dear Joey B Thank you for your lovely review and highlighting the service as well as our great location. Do please let me know when your next planning to visit so we can welcome you home. Best Regards Simon

The room was large and immaculately clean. It had a king sized bed, large tv, seating area and a huge wardrobe space. The room had black out blinds/curtains which made for a perfect night sleep. When staying at hotels we try to make the most of the services that hotel offers. We ate breakfast in Ametsa restaurant, had drinks in the hotel bar and ate from room service. All of the food was immaculately presented and the room service arrived quickly and was piping hot. The staff at the hotel were all very friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back to stay at this hotel on our next trip to London.

Dear touristgirl86 Thank you for taking the time to write a review and also for staying at our sister COMO hotels. Do let me know if you are planning to visit us or one of the other 11 hotels again soon. Best Regards Simon

If you like me prefer elegant, well kept and "not too busy" hotel this is the best London has to offer. The rooms are very spatious, nicely decorated and the service great. Location is perfect (right into Belgravia beside Green Park) for a leisure/shopping trip to London. I often spend a weekend in London and when I do I always stay at the Halkin. Highly recommended!

Dear Theo Thank you for your great review highlighting the rooms, service and great location. Zurich is very close so do come for more weekends !! Best Regards Simon

Staying at Halkin, one can be as private as you wish. One can enter lobby and be up in your spacious room with no fuss. Great bathrooms with incredible showers. Really likes the express breakfast- delivered very promptly and at a sensible price. Room service for drinks and wine also delivered very quickly. Bar area a little sterile but friendly, attentive staff do as best they can to make up for its shortfalls. Have stayed here many times, love the location.

Dear Matt Thank you for the great review and summing up The Halkin so well. Best Regards Simon

Peace and quite in the heart of London?. Yes, it's possible. Just make your next stay in London at the Halkin. My wife and I enjoy the buzz of a big city, but when we switch off we like to leave it behind. And in this little corner of Belgravia you certainly can. Great sized room, we took a Deluxe. Bathroom, very adequate even to accommodate my wife's abilities to clutter even the smallest of extremities. And did I mention that it was quiet! Staff were exceptional from the front desk, to the excellent concierge staff. All your recommendations were much appreciated, thank you. location, near perfect, literally in Buckingham Palace's back garden. Very short walk to Hyde Park, for that morning jog. And an easy walk to Harrods, although not back, with all those bags! Breakfast was great , along with the service. A small, boutique hotel, with warmth and, did I mention quiet? Happily recommend the Halkin. Room Tip: Deluxe room was a comfortable size See more room tips

Dear Adrian Thank you so much for your wonderful review. Soo quiet indeed even when we are in central London. I do hope you managed to get all the shopping bags back to Australia ! Best Regards Simon

The Halkin is a fairly small hotel located in a quiet side street in Belgravia. Staff were very efficient and helpful during check-in and throughout our short stay. The rooms were extremely comfortable and well-equipped, with good beds, efficient air conditioning and well-equipped (and fairly large) bathrooms. This was our first stay, but I would certainly recommend for those looking for an alternative to London's larger/grander hotels.

Dear ChipL-67 Thank you for your top marks review of the hotel and we look forward to welcoming you back soon Best Regards Simon

Stayed with my family and we enjoyed ever bit of the hotel. Small and very classy hotel. Centrally located but on a quiet street. Modern and comfortable rooms, with very friendly and helpful hotel staff. A really outstanding hotel.

Dear ChipL-67 Thank you for your "classy" review of The Halkin. so pleased that your family had a great stay. Do come and visit us again soon. Best Regards Simon

We arrived, for our three night stay, after an early flight to drop our bags and received the usual warm welcome and offer of complimentary drinks. The good news was the room was available for an early check-in. The hotel has a modern look and feel, but it has a calm atmosphere. The location is perfectly quiet and thatâs why we choose to return. The transport links are good; a few minuteâs walk from Hyde Park Corner for buses and tube. Please be aware that Hyde Park Corner tube station doesn't have a down escalator nor does it have a lift. There are only stairs available until the elevator renavation is completed. The rooms are a good size and very comfortable. There is a large double bed, two arm chairs with a small table and a desk. The bathroom feels large with a bath and shower. At each side of the bed there are gadgets to control the lights, air conditioning and other essentials. The bed is really comfortable. As time is always short in London we havenât tried the restaurant for breakfast or dinner. We checked out and left the luggage to collect later. On departure, as the weather was wet and the extra case was heavy with shopping, we decided to get a car to the airport. The concierge arranged this at short notice and in no time we were on our way. This is a very nice hotel with very professional staff and we will certainly return again.

Dear threehens Thank you for your lovely review. So pleased you had such a great stay and i do hope we can welcome you back soon. Just to clarify for other readers we are not under any refurbishment and the lifts are working perfectly. I think threehens stayed whilst the lifts were having their regular safety inspection and hence one was closed for a short period of time during the day. Best regards Simon

We really couldn't fault this amazing hotel with it's efficient and friendly staff, clean and comfortable room and peaceful position. The Halkin is an oasis in the midst of a bustling part of London, within walking distance of Piccadilly,Green Park and Buckingham Palace. . The attention to detail in our room and the first class attentive staff made our stay very memorable. We have no hesitation in recommending The Halkin by Como.

Thank you Christine Your review is much appreciated and i do hope we will see you again soon. Christmas shopping is always a good time to have some relaxation after a hard day at the shops. Best Regards Simon

We booked this hotel based on prior trip advisor reviews and are so happy we did. First of all, the service is amazing. The staff is always happy to help with any question and ready with a friendly smile if you are just passing through the lobby. Every suggestion they made, for dining or the best way to travel, was spot-on. We were in town to play tourist. The hotel is located near the Hyde Park Corner Underground station, but we found we almost never used the Underground to get anywhere. We could easily walk to Westminster Abbey, Victoria, Buckingham Palace, and Hyde Park. Then, because of the hotel's central location, it was often just as easy to grab a cab to where we needed to go. But when we did take the Underground, it was a quick walk to the station. I really can't recommend this hotel enough!

Dear Joey B Thank you for your lovely review and highlighting the service as well as our great location. Do please let me know when your next planning to visit so we can welcome you home. Best Regards Simon

Hotel is new and sleek with a terrific staff that accommodates every request. Hotel is located on a quiet street which is amazing and win the Mayfair district so everything is walkable including Buckingham palace) I will certainly return and will only stay here. I stayed here twice in August 2014. the BEST location in London. Room Tip: from Heathrow.... take the Heathrow express and to Paddington and taxi to hotel (30 mins to hotel) See more room tips

Dear kgera Thank you for staying with us twice in August and also for your great tip. just to clarify the taxi ride should only take 10 mins from Paddington so the whole journey from Heathrow about 30 mins. I see you live in Miami so you must try out our new hotel Metropolitan by COMO , Miami beach and tell Javier I recommended you ! Best Regards Simon

If you like me prefer elegant, well kept and "not too busy" hotel this is the best London has to offer. The rooms are very spatious, nicely decorated and the service great. Location is perfect (right into Belgravia beside Green Park) for a leisure/shopping trip to London. I often spend a weekend in London and when I do I always stay at the Halkin. Highly recommended!

Dear Theo Thank you for your great review highlighting the rooms, service and great location. Zurich is very close so do come for more weekends !! Best Regards Simon

Staying at Halkin, one can be as private as you wish. One can enter lobby and be up in your spacious room with no fuss. Great bathrooms with incredible showers. Really likes the express breakfast- delivered very promptly and at a sensible price. Room service for drinks and wine also delivered very quickly. Bar area a little sterile but friendly, attentive staff do as best they can to make up for its shortfalls. Have stayed here many times, love the location.

Dear Matt Thank you for the great review and summing up The Halkin so well. Best Regards Simon

Peace and quite in the heart of London?. Yes, it's possible. Just make your next stay in London at the Halkin. My wife and I enjoy the buzz of a big city, but when we switch off we like to leave it behind. And in this little corner of Belgravia you certainly can. Great sized room, we took a Deluxe. Bathroom, very adequate even to accommodate my wife's abilities to clutter even the smallest of extremities. And did I mention that it was quiet! Staff were exceptional from the front desk, to the excellent concierge staff. All your recommendations were much appreciated, thank you. location, near perfect, literally in Buckingham Palace's back garden. Very short walk to Hyde Park, for that morning jog. And an easy walk to Harrods, although not back, with all those bags! Breakfast was great , along with the service. A small, boutique hotel, with warmth and, did I mention quiet? Happily recommend the Halkin. Room Tip: Deluxe room was a comfortable size See more room tips

Dear Adrian Thank you so much for your wonderful review. Soo quiet indeed even when we are in central London. I do hope you managed to get all the shopping bags back to Australia ! Best Regards Simon

The Halkin is a fairly small hotel located in a quiet side street in Belgravia. Staff were very efficient and helpful during check-in and throughout our short stay. The rooms were extremely comfortable and well-equipped, with good beds, efficient air conditioning and well-equipped (and fairly large) bathrooms. This was our first stay, but I would certainly recommend for those looking for an alternative to London's larger/grander hotels.

Dear ChipL-67 Thank you for your top marks review of the hotel and we look forward to welcoming you back soon Best Regards Simon

Stayed with my family and we enjoyed ever bit of the hotel. Small and very classy hotel. Centrally located but on a quiet street. Modern and comfortable rooms, with very friendly and helpful hotel staff. A really outstanding hotel.

Dear ChipL-67 Thank you for your "classy" review of The Halkin. so pleased that your family had a great stay. Do come and visit us again soon. Best Regards Simon

We arrived, for our three night stay, after an early flight to drop our bags and received the usual warm welcome and offer of complimentary drinks. The good news was the room was available for an early check-in. The hotel has a modern look and feel, but it has a calm atmosphere. The location is perfectly quiet and thatâs why we choose to return. The transport links are good; a few minuteâs walk from Hyde Park Corner for buses and tube. Please be aware that Hyde Park Corner tube station doesn't have a down escalator nor does it have a lift. There are only stairs available until the elevator renavation is completed. The rooms are a good size and very comfortable. There is a large double bed, two arm chairs with a small table and a desk. The bathroom feels large with a bath and shower. At each side of the bed there are gadgets to control the lights, air conditioning and other essentials. The bed is really comfortable. As time is always short in London we havenât tried the restaurant for breakfast or dinner. We checked out and left the luggage to collect later. On departure, as the weather was wet and the extra case was heavy with shopping, we decided to get a car to the airport. The concierge arranged this at short notice and in no time we were on our way. This is a very nice hotel with very professional staff and we will certainly return again.

Dear threehens Thank you for your lovely review. So pleased you had such a great stay and i do hope we can welcome you back soon. Just to clarify for other readers we are not under any refurbishment and the lifts are working perfectly. I think threehens stayed whilst the lifts were having their regular safety inspection and hence one was closed for a short period of time during the day. Best regards Simon

We really couldn't fault this amazing hotel with it's efficient and friendly staff, clean and comfortable room and peaceful position. The Halkin is an oasis in the midst of a bustling part of London, within walking distance of Piccadilly,Green Park and Buckingham Palace. . The attention to detail in our room and the first class attentive staff made our stay very memorable. We have no hesitation in recommending The Halkin by Como.

Thank you Christine Your review is much appreciated and i do hope we will see you again soon. Christmas shopping is always a good time to have some relaxation after a hard day at the shops. Best Regards Simon

We booked this hotel based on prior trip advisor reviews and are so happy we did. First of all, the service is amazing. The staff is always happy to help with any question and ready with a friendly smile if you are just passing through the lobby. Every suggestion they made, for dining or the best way to travel, was spot-on. We were in town to play tourist. The hotel is located near the Hyde Park Corner Underground station, but we found we almost never used the Underground to get anywhere. We could easily walk to Westminster Abbey, Victoria, Buckingham Palace, and Hyde Park. Then, because of the hotel's central location, it was often just as easy to grab a cab to where we needed to go. But when we did take the Underground, it was a quick walk to the station. I really can't recommend this hotel enough!

Dear Joey B Thank you for your lovely review and highlighting the service as well as our great location. Do please let me know when your next planning to visit so we can welcome you home. Best Regards Simon

Hotel is new and sleek with a terrific staff that accommodates every request. Hotel is located on a quiet street which is amazing and win the Mayfair district so everything is walkable including Buckingham palace) I will certainly return and will only stay here. I stayed here twice in August 2014. the BEST location in London. Room Tip: from Heathrow.... take the Heathrow express and to Paddington and taxi to hotel (30 mins to hotel) See more room tips

Dear kgera Thank you for staying with us twice in August and also for your great tip. just to clarify the taxi ride should only take 10 mins from Paddington so the whole journey from Heathrow about 30 mins. I see you live in Miami so you must try out our new hotel Metropolitan by COMO , Miami beach and tell Javier I recommended you ! Best Regards Simon

My husband and I have just returned from a 3 night stay at The Halkin. We chose this hotel as we had previously stayed in another Como Group hotel on our honeymoon. The hotel is a boutique hotel, located in a quiet street in Belgravia. We didn't hear any road noise at all. It was a perfect base for our trip, very close to Hyde Park Corner tube stop and walking distance to a lot of sights. We stayed in a deluxe room, number 209. The room was large and immaculately clean. It had a king sized bed, large tv, seating area and a huge wardrobe space. The room had black out blinds/curtains which made for a perfect night sleep. When staying at hotels we try to make the most of the services that hotel offers. We ate breakfast in Ametsa restaurant, had drinks in the hotel bar and ate from room service. All of the food was immaculately presented and the room service arrived quickly and was piping hot. The staff at the hotel were all very friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back to stay at this hotel on our next trip to London.

Bar area a little sterile but friendly, attentive staff do as best they can to make up for its shortfalls. Have stayed here many times, love the location.

Dear Matt Thank you for the great review and summing up The Halkin so well. Best Regards Simon

Peace and quite in the heart of London?. Yes, it's possible. Just make your next stay in London at the Halkin. My wife and I enjoy the buzz of a big city, but when we switch off we like to leave it behind. And in this little corner of Belgravia you certainly can. Great sized room, we took a Deluxe. Bathroom, very adequate even to accommodate my wife's abilities to clutter even the smallest of extremities. And did I mention that it was quiet! Staff were exceptional from the front desk, to the excellent concierge staff. All your recommendations were much appreciated, thank you. location, near perfect, literally in Buckingham Palace's back garden. Very short walk to Hyde Park, for that morning jog. And an easy walk to Harrods, although not back, with all those bags! Breakfast was great , along with the service. A small, boutique hotel, with warmth and, did I mention quiet? Happily recommend the Halkin. Room Tip: Deluxe room was a comfortable size See more room tips

Dear Adrian Thank you so much for your wonderful review. Soo quiet indeed even when we are in central London. I do hope you managed to get all the shopping bags back to Australia ! Best Regards Simon

The Halkin is a fairly small hotel located in a quiet side street in Belgravia. Staff were very efficient and helpful during check-in and throughout our short stay. The rooms were extremely comfortable and well-equipped, with good beds, efficient air conditioning and well-equipped (and fairly large) bathrooms. This was our first stay, but I would certainly recommend for those looking for an alternative to London's larger/grander hotels.

Dear ChipL-67 Thank you for your top marks review of the hotel and we look forward to welcoming you back soon Best Regards Simon

Stayed with my family and we enjoyed ever bit of the hotel. Small and very classy hotel. Centrally located but on a quiet street. Modern and comfortable rooms, with very friendly and helpful hotel staff. A really outstanding hotel.

Dear ChipL-67 Thank you for your "classy" review of The Halkin. so pleased that your family had a great stay. Do come and visit us again soon. Best Regards Simon

We arrived, for our three night stay, after an early flight to drop our bags and received the usual warm welcome and offer of complimentary drinks. The good news was the room was available for an early check-in. The hotel has a modern look and feel, but it has a calm atmosphere. The location is perfectly quiet and thatâs why we choose to return. The transport links are good; a few minuteâs walk from Hyde Park Corner for buses and tube. Please be aware that Hyde Park Corner tube station doesn't have a down escalator nor does it have a lift. There are only stairs available until the elevator renavation is completed. The rooms are a good size and very comfortable. There is a large double bed, two arm chairs with a small table and a desk. The bathroom feels large with a bath and shower. At each side of the bed there are gadgets to control the lights, air conditioning and other essentials. The bed is really comfortable. As time is always short in London we havenât tried the restaurant for breakfast or dinner. We checked out and left the luggage to collect later. On departure, as the weather was wet and the extra case was heavy with shopping, we decided to get a car to the airport. The concierge arranged this at short notice and in no time we were on our way. This is a very nice hotel with very professional staff and we will certainly return again.

Dear threehens Thank you for your lovely review. So pleased you had such a great stay and i do hope we can welcome you back soon. Just to clarify for other readers we are not under any refurbishment and the lifts are working perfectly. I think threehens stayed whilst the lifts were having their regular safety inspection and hence one was closed for a short period of time during the day. Best regards Simon

We really couldn't fault this amazing hotel with it's efficient and friendly staff, clean and comfortable room and peaceful position. The Halkin is an oasis in the midst of a bustling part of London, within walking distance of Piccadilly,Green Park and Buckingham Palace. . The attention to detail in our room and the first class attentive staff made our stay very memorable. We have no hesitation in recommending The Halkin by Como.

Thank you Christine Your review is much appreciated and i do hope we will see you again soon. Christmas shopping is always a good time to have some relaxation after a hard day at the shops. Best Regards Simon

We booked this hotel based on prior trip advisor reviews and are so happy we did. First of all, the service is amazing. The staff is always happy to help with any question and ready with a friendly smile if you are just passing through the lobby. Every suggestion they made, for dining or the best way to travel, was spot-on. We were in town to play tourist. The hotel is located near the Hyde Park Corner Underground station, but we found we almost never used the Underground to get anywhere. We could easily walk to Westminster Abbey, Victoria, Buckingham Palace, and Hyde Park. Then, because of the hotel's central location, it was often just as easy to grab a cab to where we needed to go. But when we did take the Underground, it was a quick walk to the station. I really can't recommend this hotel enough!

Dear Joey B Thank you for your lovely review and highlighting the service as well as our great location. Do please let me know when your next planning to visit so we can welcome you home. Best Regards Simon

Hotel is new and sleek with a terrific staff that accommodates every request. Hotel is located on a quiet street which is amazing and win the Mayfair district so everything is walkable including Buckingham palace) I will certainly return and will only stay here. I stayed here twice in August 2014. the BEST location in London. Room Tip: from Heathrow.... take the Heathrow express and to Paddington and taxi to hotel (30 mins to hotel) See more room tips

Dear kgera Thank you for staying with us twice in August and also for your great tip. just to clarify the taxi ride should only take 10 mins from Paddington so the whole journey from Heathrow about 30 mins. I see you live in Miami so you must try out our new hotel Metropolitan by COMO , Miami beach and tell Javier I recommended you ! Best Regards Simon

My husband and I have just returned from a 3 night stay at The Halkin. We chose this hotel as we had previously stayed in another Como Group hotel on our honeymoon. The hotel is a boutique hotel, located in a quiet street in Belgravia. We didn't hear any road noise at all. It was a perfect base for our trip, very close to Hyde Park Corner tube stop and walking distance to a lot of sights. We stayed in a deluxe room, number 209. The room was large and immaculately clean. It had a king sized bed, large tv, seating area and a huge wardrobe space. The room had black out blinds/curtains which made for a perfect night sleep. When staying at hotels we try to make the most of the services that hotel offers. We ate breakfast in Ametsa restaurant, had drinks in the hotel bar and ate from room service. All of the food was immaculately presented and the room service arrived quickly and was piping hot. The staff at the hotel were all very friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back to stay at this hotel on our next trip to London.

Dear touristgirl86 Thank you for taking the time to write a review and also for staying at our sister COMO hotels. Do let me know if you are planning to visit us or one of the other 11 hotels again soon. Best Regards Simon

If you like me prefer elegant, well kept and "not too busy" hotel this is the best London has to offer. The rooms are very spatious, nicely decorated and the service great. Location is perfect (right into Belgravia beside Green Park) for a leisure/shopping trip to London. I often spend a weekend in London and when I do I always stay at the Halkin. Highly recommended!

Dear Theo Thank you for your great review highlighting the rooms, service and great location. Zurich is very close so do come for more weekends !! Best Regards Simon

And an easy walk to Harrods, although not back, with all those bags! Breakfast was great , along with the service. A small, boutique hotel, with warmth and, did I mention quiet? Happily recommend the Halkin. Room Tip: Deluxe room was a comfortable size See more room tips

Dear Adrian Thank you so much for your wonderful review. Soo quiet indeed even when we are in central London. I do hope you managed to get all the shopping bags back to Australia ! Best Regards Simon

The Halkin is a fairly small hotel located in a quiet side street in Belgravia. Staff were very efficient and helpful during check-in and throughout our short stay. The rooms were extremely comfortable and well-equipped, with good beds, efficient air conditioning and well-equipped (and fairly large) bathrooms. This was our first stay, but I would certainly recommend for those looking for an alternative to London's larger/grander hotels.

Dear ChipL-67 Thank you for your top marks review of the hotel and we look forward to welcoming you back soon Best Regards Simon

Stayed with my family and we enjoyed ever bit of the hotel. Small and very classy hotel. Centrally located but on a quiet street. Modern and comfortable rooms, with very friendly and helpful hotel staff. A really outstanding hotel.

Dear ChipL-67 Thank you for your "classy" review of The Halkin. so pleased that your family had a great stay. Do come and visit us again soon. Best Regards Simon
