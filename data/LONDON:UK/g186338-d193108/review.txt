My sister and I spent 4 nights There in August and we had a great time. The staff is super friendly and always ready to help. The rooms are on the bigger side (speccially for London). Location is perfect and very central. We have nothing to Say but compliments!

was lucky enough to be invited by my future son in law to a surprise engagement party in one of the elegant private dining rooms. Everything about this hotel is class but above all the people are brilliant and made my daughter and her fiancÃ©e feel very special

As you enter the hotel you find out the touches of the best hotel interior designer in the world call "Tony Chi". An other chef d'oeuvre. The service is great and friendly and up to the Rosewood reputation. The all day dinning is great and relaxing and serve a great buffet breakfast. Cafe Latte do take time to make for What ever reason but the staff are great,attentive, and well dressed. The Scarfes Bar is very well done and give a real feeling of London and display provoking painting by Gerald Scarfe. The Holborn Dining room decorate like a Pub is quite enjoyable with British specialities. The staff are very friendly and the manager wearing old and colorful British style clothes is quite attentive to the guest need. the Spa and the Gym are well equipped but are disappointment in comparison of the Corinthia Hotel The Room are nice and well decorated with a Zen touch. It is definitively a great hotel to stay. Room Tip: The room are nice and well appointed See more room tips

This should have earned all 5 'stars' as we loved the hotel and most of it. The building is beautiful, the location is fantastic, the room is luxurious, and the decor is tastefully modern with an old world feel, without being too generic or kitsch. However our stay was marred by rude and indifferent service by the greeter at the entrance and wait staff at the bar respectively. Based on other reviews, it looks like we experienced an anomaly, which is tough luck for us but that's still unpleasant and didn't leave us with the best memory.

Rosewood, yet again, does not disappoint. Our stay in this oasis in London was an exceptional experience. We were welcomed by their attentive and friendly staff, enjoyed the hotels elegant public spaces and our room was spacious and well appointed. The house cars were made available to us on several occasions and the drivers were happy to share their knowledge of the city with us. Special thanks to Lisa who helped to make our stay especially memorable. Room Tip: our room overlooking the courtyard was especially quiet See more room tips

A fabulous hotel, with a great lounge and restaurant and bar. Centrally located. The best beds. Quiet. The service is superb. Will definitely return. The restaurant food was of the best. They provided free newspapers from around the world as well as free wifi. A real treat to stay there.

From the moment I booked this hotel I knew it was going to be good. I received several emails enquiring as to how they might make my arrival and stay more comfortable. Their normal check-in time is 2pm but they asked our arrival time and whether an earlier check-in was required. We were arriving from Dubai at 6am and I said we would be very grateful for a 9am check -in. When we arrived at 9am our room was ready. Having been in transit for more than 24 hours an immediate soak in the deep bathtub was bliss. We were revived and ready to tackle London by 11am. We stayed 5 nights and it was first class at all times. The rooms are beautiful, the restaurants and bars worth a visit in their own right and the public areas of the hotel very charming. The location is excellent with tube station close and Covent garden and the British Museum both easy walks.

We are big fans of Rosewood Hotels. We stay regularly at Rosewood Mayakoba and Jumby Bay. We choose Rosewood year after year for the top end suites, locations and most of all the service. This was our first visit to a "city" hotel by Rosewood and it did not disappoint. I visited for two nights with my Mother during our 7 day UK trip. We were welcomed like family and received Royal treatment. The hotel is gorgeous - we felt like we were in a manor home. Stately indeed with lovely London accents. Our room was quite spacious and filled with all the necessary amenities. Service was great all around. We only took breakfast at the hotel and it was fantastic. The public rooms are gorgeous as are the restaurants. We enjoyed the atmosphere in Scarfes bar one late afternoon which was lively with well heeled locals. We made good use of the house cars - which were conveniently equipped with complimentary wifi - a great touch. The location was convenient for us and I would highly recommend this hotel.

The location is great for the inns in London, aside of this the location is not in the nicest part of town but perfect for a business trip or a weekend away if you don't mind not being in the nicer parts of London. However, the hotel makes up for the location. The rooms are lovely, the decor is amazing, two large very comfy double beds, a nespresso coffee machine for your early morning coffee and a gorgeous marble bathroom. I could happily have stayed in the room all day if I didn't have anywhere else to be.

I stayed there for 4 nights with my husband and 9 years old son. 2 double comfortable beds in a spacious room is perfect for us. All the offical pictures are true! We can get what we see! Super convenient locations for shopping and sightseeing. Hotel is beautiful, classic, cosy and clean. Everything is well organised. Good service, all staff are nice. We had the stay 3 nights with the 4th night free package, very good value considering such a good quality hotel in London. Will definitely come back. High recommend to everyone.

The building is beautiful, the location is fantastic, the room is luxurious, and the decor is tastefully modern with an old world feel, without being too generic or kitsch. However our stay was marred by rude and indifferent service by the greeter at the entrance and wait staff at the bar respectively. Based on other reviews, it looks like we experienced an anomaly, which is tough luck for us but that's still unpleasant and didn't leave us with the best memory.

Rosewood, yet again, does not disappoint. Our stay in this oasis in London was an exceptional experience. We were welcomed by their attentive and friendly staff, enjoyed the hotels elegant public spaces and our room was spacious and well appointed. The house cars were made available to us on several occasions and the drivers were happy to share their knowledge of the city with us. Special thanks to Lisa who helped to make our stay especially memorable. Room Tip: our room overlooking the courtyard was especially quiet See more room tips

A fabulous hotel, with a great lounge and restaurant and bar. Centrally located. The best beds. Quiet. The service is superb. Will definitely return. The restaurant food was of the best. They provided free newspapers from around the world as well as free wifi. A real treat to stay there.

From the moment I booked this hotel I knew it was going to be good. I received several emails enquiring as to how they might make my arrival and stay more comfortable. Their normal check-in time is 2pm but they asked our arrival time and whether an earlier check-in was required. We were arriving from Dubai at 6am and I said we would be very grateful for a 9am check -in. When we arrived at 9am our room was ready. Having been in transit for more than 24 hours an immediate soak in the deep bathtub was bliss. We were revived and ready to tackle London by 11am. We stayed 5 nights and it was first class at all times. The rooms are beautiful, the restaurants and bars worth a visit in their own right and the public areas of the hotel very charming. The location is excellent with tube station close and Covent garden and the British Museum both easy walks.

We are big fans of Rosewood Hotels. We stay regularly at Rosewood Mayakoba and Jumby Bay. We choose Rosewood year after year for the top end suites, locations and most of all the service. This was our first visit to a "city" hotel by Rosewood and it did not disappoint. I visited for two nights with my Mother during our 7 day UK trip. We were welcomed like family and received Royal treatment. The hotel is gorgeous - we felt like we were in a manor home. Stately indeed with lovely London accents. Our room was quite spacious and filled with all the necessary amenities. Service was great all around. We only took breakfast at the hotel and it was fantastic. The public rooms are gorgeous as are the restaurants. We enjoyed the atmosphere in Scarfes bar one late afternoon which was lively with well heeled locals. We made good use of the house cars - which were conveniently equipped with complimentary wifi - a great touch. The location was convenient for us and I would highly recommend this hotel.

The location is great for the inns in London, aside of this the location is not in the nicest part of town but perfect for a business trip or a weekend away if you don't mind not being in the nicer parts of London. However, the hotel makes up for the location. The rooms are lovely, the decor is amazing, two large very comfy double beds, a nespresso coffee machine for your early morning coffee and a gorgeous marble bathroom. I could happily have stayed in the room all day if I didn't have anywhere else to be.

I stayed there for 4 nights with my husband and 9 years old son. 2 double comfortable beds in a spacious room is perfect for us. All the offical pictures are true! We can get what we see! Super convenient locations for shopping and sightseeing. Hotel is beautiful, classic, cosy and clean. Everything is well organised. Good service, all staff are nice. We had the stay 3 nights with the 4th night free package, very good value considering such a good quality hotel in London. Will definitely come back. High recommend to everyone.

My sister and I spent 4 nights There in August and we had a great time. The staff is super friendly and always ready to help. The rooms are on the bigger side (speccially for London). Location is perfect and very central. We have nothing to Say but compliments!

was lucky enough to be invited by my future son in law to a surprise engagement party in one of the elegant private dining rooms. Everything about this hotel is class but above all the people are brilliant and made my daughter and her fiancÃ©e feel very special

As you enter the hotel you find out the touches of the best hotel interior designer in the world call "Tony Chi". An other chef d'oeuvre. The service is great and friendly and up to the Rosewood reputation. The all day dinning is great and relaxing and serve a great buffet breakfast. Cafe Latte do take time to make for What ever reason but the staff are great,attentive, and well dressed. The Scarfes Bar is very well done and give a real feeling of London and display provoking painting by Gerald Scarfe. The Holborn Dining room decorate like a Pub is quite enjoyable with British specialities. The staff are very friendly and the manager wearing old and colorful British style clothes is quite attentive to the guest need. the Spa and the Gym are well equipped but are disappointment in comparison of the Corinthia Hotel The Room are nice and well decorated with a Zen touch.

From the moment I booked this hotel I knew it was going to be good. I received several emails enquiring as to how they might make my arrival and stay more comfortable. Their normal check-in time is 2pm but they asked our arrival time and whether an earlier check-in was required. We were arriving from Dubai at 6am and I said we would be very grateful for a 9am check -in. When we arrived at 9am our room was ready. Having been in transit for more than 24 hours an immediate soak in the deep bathtub was bliss. We were revived and ready to tackle London by 11am. We stayed 5 nights and it was first class at all times. The rooms are beautiful, the restaurants and bars worth a visit in their own right and the public areas of the hotel very charming. The location is excellent with tube station close and Covent garden and the British Museum both easy walks.

We are big fans of Rosewood Hotels. We stay regularly at Rosewood Mayakoba and Jumby Bay. We choose Rosewood year after year for the top end suites, locations and most of all the service. This was our first visit to a "city" hotel by Rosewood and it did not disappoint. I visited for two nights with my Mother during our 7 day UK trip. We were welcomed like family and received Royal treatment. The hotel is gorgeous - we felt like we were in a manor home. Stately indeed with lovely London accents. Our room was quite spacious and filled with all the necessary amenities. Service was great all around. We only took breakfast at the hotel and it was fantastic. The public rooms are gorgeous as are the restaurants. We enjoyed the atmosphere in Scarfes bar one late afternoon which was lively with well heeled locals. We made good use of the house cars - which were conveniently equipped with complimentary wifi - a great touch. The location was convenient for us and I would highly recommend this hotel.

The location is great for the inns in London, aside of this the location is not in the nicest part of town but perfect for a business trip or a weekend away if you don't mind not being in the nicer parts of London. However, the hotel makes up for the location. The rooms are lovely, the decor is amazing, two large very comfy double beds, a nespresso coffee machine for your early morning coffee and a gorgeous marble bathroom. I could happily have stayed in the room all day if I didn't have anywhere else to be.

I stayed there for 4 nights with my husband and 9 years old son. 2 double comfortable beds in a spacious room is perfect for us. All the offical pictures are true! We can get what we see! Super convenient locations for shopping and sightseeing. Hotel is beautiful, classic, cosy and clean. Everything is well organised. Good service, all staff are nice. We had the stay 3 nights with the 4th night free package, very good value considering such a good quality hotel in London. Will definitely come back. High recommend to everyone.

My sister and I spent 4 nights There in August and we had a great time. The staff is super friendly and always ready to help. The rooms are on the bigger side (speccially for London). Location is perfect and very central. We have nothing to Say but compliments!

was lucky enough to be invited by my future son in law to a surprise engagement party in one of the elegant private dining rooms. Everything about this hotel is class but above all the people are brilliant and made my daughter and her fiancÃ©e feel very special

As you enter the hotel you find out the touches of the best hotel interior designer in the world call "Tony Chi". An other chef d'oeuvre. The service is great and friendly and up to the Rosewood reputation. The all day dinning is great and relaxing and serve a great buffet breakfast. Cafe Latte do take time to make for What ever reason but the staff are great,attentive, and well dressed. The Scarfes Bar is very well done and give a real feeling of London and display provoking painting by Gerald Scarfe. The Holborn Dining room decorate like a Pub is quite enjoyable with British specialities. The staff are very friendly and the manager wearing old and colorful British style clothes is quite attentive to the guest need. the Spa and the Gym are well equipped but are disappointment in comparison of the Corinthia Hotel The Room are nice and well decorated with a Zen touch. It is definitively a great hotel to stay. Room Tip: The room are nice and well appointed See more room tips

This should have earned all 5 'stars' as we loved the hotel and most of it. The building is beautiful, the location is fantastic, the room is luxurious, and the decor is tastefully modern with an old world feel, without being too generic or kitsch. However our stay was marred by rude and indifferent service by the greeter at the entrance and wait staff at the bar respectively. Based on other reviews, it looks like we experienced an anomaly, which is tough luck for us but that's still unpleasant and didn't leave us with the best memory.

Rosewood, yet again, does not disappoint. Our stay in this oasis in London was an exceptional experience. We were welcomed by their attentive and friendly staff, enjoyed the hotels elegant public spaces and our room was spacious and well appointed. The house cars were made available to us on several occasions and the drivers were happy to share their knowledge of the city with us.

This was our first visit to a "city" hotel by Rosewood and it did not disappoint. I visited for two nights with my Mother during our 7 day UK trip. We were welcomed like family and received Royal treatment. The hotel is gorgeous - we felt like we were in a manor home. Stately indeed with lovely London accents. Our room was quite spacious and filled with all the necessary amenities. Service was great all around. We only took breakfast at the hotel and it was fantastic. The public rooms are gorgeous as are the restaurants. We enjoyed the atmosphere in Scarfes bar one late afternoon which was lively with well heeled locals. We made good use of the house cars - which were conveniently equipped with complimentary wifi - a great touch. The location was convenient for us and I would highly recommend this hotel.

The location is great for the inns in London, aside of this the location is not in the nicest part of town but perfect for a business trip or a weekend away if you don't mind not being in the nicer parts of London. However, the hotel makes up for the location. The rooms are lovely, the decor is amazing, two large very comfy double beds, a nespresso coffee machine for your early morning coffee and a gorgeous marble bathroom. I could happily have stayed in the room all day if I didn't have anywhere else to be.

I stayed there for 4 nights with my husband and 9 years old son. 2 double comfortable beds in a spacious room is perfect for us. All the offical pictures are true! We can get what we see! Super convenient locations for shopping and sightseeing. Hotel is beautiful, classic, cosy and clean. Everything is well organised. Good service, all staff are nice. We had the stay 3 nights with the 4th night free package, very good value considering such a good quality hotel in London. Will definitely come back. High recommend to everyone.

My sister and I spent 4 nights There in August and we had a great time. The staff is super friendly and always ready to help. The rooms are on the bigger side (speccially for London). Location is perfect and very central. We have nothing to Say but compliments!

was lucky enough to be invited by my future son in law to a surprise engagement party in one of the elegant private dining rooms. Everything about this hotel is class but above all the people are brilliant and made my daughter and her fiancÃ©e feel very special

As you enter the hotel you find out the touches of the best hotel interior designer in the world call "Tony Chi". An other chef d'oeuvre. The service is great and friendly and up to the Rosewood reputation. The all day dinning is great and relaxing and serve a great buffet breakfast. Cafe Latte do take time to make for What ever reason but the staff are great,attentive, and well dressed. The Scarfes Bar is very well done and give a real feeling of London and display provoking painting by Gerald Scarfe. The Holborn Dining room decorate like a Pub is quite enjoyable with British specialities. The staff are very friendly and the manager wearing old and colorful British style clothes is quite attentive to the guest need. the Spa and the Gym are well equipped but are disappointment in comparison of the Corinthia Hotel The Room are nice and well decorated with a Zen touch. It is definitively a great hotel to stay. Room Tip: The room are nice and well appointed See more room tips

This should have earned all 5 'stars' as we loved the hotel and most of it. The building is beautiful, the location is fantastic, the room is luxurious, and the decor is tastefully modern with an old world feel, without being too generic or kitsch. However our stay was marred by rude and indifferent service by the greeter at the entrance and wait staff at the bar respectively. Based on other reviews, it looks like we experienced an anomaly, which is tough luck for us but that's still unpleasant and didn't leave us with the best memory.

Rosewood, yet again, does not disappoint. Our stay in this oasis in London was an exceptional experience. We were welcomed by their attentive and friendly staff, enjoyed the hotels elegant public spaces and our room was spacious and well appointed. The house cars were made available to us on several occasions and the drivers were happy to share their knowledge of the city with us. Special thanks to Lisa who helped to make our stay especially memorable. Room Tip: our room overlooking the courtyard was especially quiet See more room tips

A fabulous hotel, with a great lounge and restaurant and bar. Centrally located. The best beds. Quiet. The service is superb. Will definitely return. The restaurant food was of the best. They provided free newspapers from around the world as well as free wifi. A real treat to stay there.

From the moment I booked this hotel I knew it was going to be good. I received several emails enquiring as to how they might make my arrival and stay more comfortable. Their normal check-in time is 2pm but they asked our arrival time and whether an earlier check-in was required. We were arriving from Dubai at 6am and I said we would be very grateful for a 9am check -in. When we arrived at 9am our room was ready. Having been in transit for more than 24 hours an immediate soak in the deep bathtub was bliss. We were revived and ready to tackle London by 11am. We stayed 5 nights and it was first class at all times. The rooms are beautiful, the restaurants and bars worth a visit in their own right and the public areas of the hotel very charming. The location is excellent with tube station close and Covent garden and the British Museum both easy walks.

I could happily have stayed in the room all day if I didn't have anywhere else to be.

I stayed there for 4 nights with my husband and 9 years old son. 2 double comfortable beds in a spacious room is perfect for us. All the offical pictures are true! We can get what we see! Super convenient locations for shopping and sightseeing. Hotel is beautiful, classic, cosy and clean. Everything is well organised. Good service, all staff are nice. We had the stay 3 nights with the 4th night free package, very good value considering such a good quality hotel in London. Will definitely come back. High recommend to everyone.

My sister and I spent 4 nights There in August and we had a great time. The staff is super friendly and always ready to help. The rooms are on the bigger side (speccially for London). Location is perfect and very central. We have nothing to Say but compliments!

was lucky enough to be invited by my future son in law to a surprise engagement party in one of the elegant private dining rooms. Everything about this hotel is class but above all the people are brilliant and made my daughter and her fiancÃ©e feel very special

As you enter the hotel you find out the touches of the best hotel interior designer in the world call "Tony Chi". An other chef d'oeuvre. The service is great and friendly and up to the Rosewood reputation. The all day dinning is great and relaxing and serve a great buffet breakfast. Cafe Latte do take time to make for What ever reason but the staff are great,attentive, and well dressed. The Scarfes Bar is very well done and give a real feeling of London and display provoking painting by Gerald Scarfe. The Holborn Dining room decorate like a Pub is quite enjoyable with British specialities. The staff are very friendly and the manager wearing old and colorful British style clothes is quite attentive to the guest need. the Spa and the Gym are well equipped but are disappointment in comparison of the Corinthia Hotel The Room are nice and well decorated with a Zen touch. It is definitively a great hotel to stay. Room Tip: The room are nice and well appointed See more room tips

This should have earned all 5 'stars' as we loved the hotel and most of it. The building is beautiful, the location is fantastic, the room is luxurious, and the decor is tastefully modern with an old world feel, without being too generic or kitsch. However our stay was marred by rude and indifferent service by the greeter at the entrance and wait staff at the bar respectively. Based on other reviews, it looks like we experienced an anomaly, which is tough luck for us but that's still unpleasant and didn't leave us with the best memory.

Rosewood, yet again, does not disappoint. Our stay in this oasis in London was an exceptional experience. We were welcomed by their attentive and friendly staff, enjoyed the hotels elegant public spaces and our room was spacious and well appointed. The house cars were made available to us on several occasions and the drivers were happy to share their knowledge of the city with us. Special thanks to Lisa who helped to make our stay especially memorable. Room Tip: our room overlooking the courtyard was especially quiet See more room tips

A fabulous hotel, with a great lounge and restaurant and bar. Centrally located. The best beds. Quiet. The service is superb. Will definitely return. The restaurant food was of the best. They provided free newspapers from around the world as well as free wifi. A real treat to stay there.

From the moment I booked this hotel I knew it was going to be good. I received several emails enquiring as to how they might make my arrival and stay more comfortable. Their normal check-in time is 2pm but they asked our arrival time and whether an earlier check-in was required. We were arriving from Dubai at 6am and I said we would be very grateful for a 9am check -in. When we arrived at 9am our room was ready. Having been in transit for more than 24 hours an immediate soak in the deep bathtub was bliss. We were revived and ready to tackle London by 11am. We stayed 5 nights and it was first class at all times. The rooms are beautiful, the restaurants and bars worth a visit in their own right and the public areas of the hotel very charming. The location is excellent with tube station close and Covent garden and the British Museum both easy walks.

We are big fans of Rosewood Hotels. We stay regularly at Rosewood Mayakoba and Jumby Bay. We choose Rosewood year after year for the top end suites, locations and most of all the service. This was our first visit to a "city" hotel by Rosewood and it did not disappoint. I visited for two nights with my Mother during our 7 day UK trip. We were welcomed like family and received Royal treatment. The hotel is gorgeous - we felt like we were in a manor home. Stately indeed with lovely London accents. Our room was quite spacious and filled with all the necessary amenities. Service was great all around. We only took breakfast at the hotel and it was fantastic. The public rooms are gorgeous as are the restaurants. We enjoyed the atmosphere in Scarfes bar one late afternoon which was lively with well heeled locals. We made good use of the house cars - which were conveniently equipped with complimentary wifi - a great touch. The location was convenient for us and I would highly recommend this hotel.

The location is great for the inns in London, aside of this the location is not in the nicest part of town but perfect for a business trip or a weekend away if you don't mind not being in the nicer parts of London.
