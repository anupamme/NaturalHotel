We have just returned from a perfect weekend trip for our Anniversary. We arrived on Friday and were very impressed with the location and the "look" of the hotel, especially the beautiful courtyard. It is a five minute walk from the tube and is in such a great place for all the best sight-seeing in London. The area was quiet and felt very safe. From the first moments, the staff at 51 Buckingham Gate made us feel like we had arrived somewhere very special indeed. Their attentiveness and courtesy are what we will remember most about our stay. We were upgraded to a 2 bedroom apartment (falconers) on the seventh floor, with stunning views. It had everything we needed and Sergio, the concierge, showed us everything in the room and gave us lots of info about amenities in the local area. We only ate breakfast at the hotel, which was excellent both days. A fantastic selection and again the service was first class, especially Errol and Georgio. The complimentary canapÃ©s and drinks in the library each evening were a really nice treat and we spent a lovely evening in the company of the two waiters from Hungary and Spain, who were so attentive and great to chat to. We can't wait to return to the hotel - we were treated royally by everyone we met and were made to feel truly "at home". Thank you to all at 51 Buckingham Gate for making our Anniversary so very special. Room Tip: The views from the seventh floor were fantastic. See more room tips

Stayed at this hotel for the 4th time This time we were in a two bedroom apartment in Falconers Building Usual excellent service from staff. Special thanks to Erol and Eva in breakfast room for all their care and attention to us and granddaughters. Also thank you to the conceirge team.Our 2 bathroom suite had a walk in shower and a tub shower . one suggestion-- tub/showers need hand rail for getting in and out of tub. otherwise perfect hotel for stay in London.We will definitely stay at this hotel again Room Tip: We Liked the Kings building .Has private entrance We stayed there on our previous visit See more room tips

Fantastic stay at this hotel, great location, great service. Was upgraded on arrival and everything was perfect. The staff assisted us with restaurants, attractions, travel tickets, we would definitely stay here again.

I am a huge fan of the Taj hotels having stayed at many around the world. Taj 51 is next door to the Taj St James Court. (Do NOT stay there.....very noisy and awful service). Taj 51 is a gorgeous property with lovely large suites. Our room was a King Suite and had a large bedroom, separate large living room, small modern kitchen, and a reasonable bathroom. (I would have given this hotel 5 stars if the bathroom had been as impressive as the rest of the room, but the bathroom was quite small). The service is fantastic and they were always offering help with transportation, reservations, anything you need. Wifi is free. There is no parking. They offer a full continental and made to order breakfast. My only complaint is that the continental breakfast, although offered a lot of options and was delicious, really wasnt work 20 GBP. It should have been included in the (extremely high) price. The location is PERFECT. It is a 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace; 7 minutes to Clarence house/St James Palace; 15 minute walk to Big Ben/Houses of Parliament/Westminster Abbey; 7 minute drive to Harrods (probably about 25 minute walk); 10 minute walk to Trafalgar Square.......everything is very close. Try the attached, Michelin starred Quinlon restaurant. It is amazing south west Indian food. it is unlike anything you have tried.The flavors are unique with loads of both meat and vegetarian options. Bistro 51 has a great Ahi Tuna Tartar and a lovely afternoon tea. The price to stay here can be VERY high but is expected due to the room size and location. Although this Taj property isnt as nice a some of those located in South Africa and India, it is still a very nice property and will not disappoint. Room Tip: Request a room on a higher level to avoid any noise concerns. See more room tips

I cannot say enough how much my wife and I enjoyed our stay at Taj 51. We were in London for four days celebrating our 15th anniversary and we had not been on a trip since our kids were born over 8 years ago. Without stating the obvious, this was a very special trip for us. You have probably read about the service at the Taj and because we read these with a bit of caution we were slightly skeptical that it would live up to our expectations. Well our expectations were not met, but exceeded with flying colors. We packed about seven days of activities into four and all of this was made so much easier by service unlike any my wife and I have ever enjoyed. From several weeks before our trip to our actual stay in London, the staff was on top of everything. I felt like a pest before our trip by emailing every random question and request and they responded with timely well thoughtout answers that made our trip planning especially effortless. We have been places where the concierge will tell you how do things or help point you in the right direction, but the concierges at the Taj would handle everything from event tickets to train tickets and even dinner reservations. They even knew our names from the moment we stepped in until we left no matter who was on duty. The accommodations were fantastic and they have a really nice canape and drink event nightly and the hotel location is fantastic. Staying at Taj 51 was truly one of the best experiences my wife and I have been apart of.

this hotel never fails to suprise me on each and every visit. the suites are beautiful the staff are charming, helpful and in abundence. we had a fantastic stay. thank you all again we will be returning very soon. if your looking for a flagship hotel in london ypu wont be disapointed.

My wife and I stayed at this hotel to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. We stayed in one of the Minister suites which was simply fantastic. The rooms were equipped with everything that we needed for a 3 day stay. The location was great and the breakfasts were lovely. The staff are so attentive and are a credit to the hotel. We were made to feel extra special and it really added to the weekend. We will definitely stay at this hotel again. I would go as far to say that this hotel is the best in London - Mr Thorpe

The service and the rooms were superb, is our first visit in London and they make this moment unforgetable..! Is close to the sub station, you have all the main attractions from London just by walking, they have a wonderful cafe cross the street, for a good breakfast before the tourist walk.

Thank you for reviewing your recent stay at Taj 51 Buckingham Gate. I was delighted to read you enjoyed your suite and our famous Taj Service. I was pleased to read that your first trip to London and my team created a nice memory for you. We are within walking distant to many attractions around London includling Buckingham Palace, House of Commons, Ben Big and many more and with St. James Park Tube Station only 2 minutes walk away. I hope that your next visit to London we will be able to welcoming you back to Taj London. Best Regards Araceli Ruis-Perez Hotel Manager

We have stayed here often and from our understanding the hotel was taken back by the Taj group following management by another hotel chain. The hotel is synonymous with the Taj chain, which is our favourite chain of hotel and renowned for its superb service. Same for this hotel, service was excellent and surprisingly personal for a hotel of this size. Nothing was too much trouble. We were in a junior suite so there was plenty of room with TVs in both rooms. Beautiful courtyard with a fountain. Luckily the weather was great and we were able to enjoy lunches out there. Wifi excellent â free and fast. Perfect location and walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Big Ben, Green Park, St James Park, Victoria, Piccadilly and many other top spots. The tube station is just around the corner. Highly recommended

We stayed here with two of our close friends and stayed in the minister suites ... They were apartments!! So amazing and nothing was too much trouble.. The drinks in the court yard were great and a lovely touch with canapÃ©s Everything was so comfy and welcoming... TV in the bath!! Wow!! We went for breakfast in the morning and was the best I've tasted! Also the extras of smoked salmon, avocado and much more! Really was the best hotel we have stayed in!! Thank you to the staff that made us feel so welcome

Thank you for taking the time to write about your recent stay at Taj 51 Buckingham Gate. I am delighted you enjoyed your suite in Minsters and the facilities within the suite.

The hotel is synonymous with the Taj chain, which is our favourite chain of hotel and renowned for its superb service. Same for this hotel, service was excellent and surprisingly personal for a hotel of this size. Nothing was too much trouble. We were in a junior suite so there was plenty of room with TVs in both rooms. Beautiful courtyard with a fountain. Luckily the weather was great and we were able to enjoy lunches out there. Wifi excellent â free and fast. Perfect location and walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Big Ben, Green Park, St James Park, Victoria, Piccadilly and many other top spots. The tube station is just around the corner. Highly recommended

We stayed here with two of our close friends and stayed in the minister suites ... They were apartments!! So amazing and nothing was too much trouble.. The drinks in the court yard were great and a lovely touch with canapÃ©s Everything was so comfy and welcoming... TV in the bath!! Wow!! We went for breakfast in the morning and was the best I've tasted! Also the extras of smoked salmon, avocado and much more! Really was the best hotel we have stayed in!! Thank you to the staff that made us feel so welcome

Thank you for taking the time to write about your recent stay at Taj 51 Buckingham Gate. I am delighted you enjoyed your suite in Minsters and the facilities within the suite. Our Complimentry Drinks and Canapes are very popular with our guest and pleased you were able to join us. We do hope that we will have the pleasure of welcoming back again soon.

We have just returned from a perfect weekend trip for our Anniversary. We arrived on Friday and were very impressed with the location and the "look" of the hotel, especially the beautiful courtyard. It is a five minute walk from the tube and is in such a great place for all the best sight-seeing in London. The area was quiet and felt very safe. From the first moments, the staff at 51 Buckingham Gate made us feel like we had arrived somewhere very special indeed. Their attentiveness and courtesy are what we will remember most about our stay. We were upgraded to a 2 bedroom apartment (falconers) on the seventh floor, with stunning views. It had everything we needed and Sergio, the concierge, showed us everything in the room and gave us lots of info about amenities in the local area. We only ate breakfast at the hotel, which was excellent both days. A fantastic selection and again the service was first class, especially Errol and Georgio. The complimentary canapÃ©s and drinks in the library each evening were a really nice treat and we spent a lovely evening in the company of the two waiters from Hungary and Spain, who were so attentive and great to chat to. We can't wait to return to the hotel - we were treated royally by everyone we met and were made to feel truly "at home". Thank you to all at 51 Buckingham Gate for making our Anniversary so very special. Room Tip: The views from the seventh floor were fantastic. See more room tips

Stayed at this hotel for the 4th time This time we were in a two bedroom apartment in Falconers Building Usual excellent service from staff. Special thanks to Erol and Eva in breakfast room for all their care and attention to us and granddaughters. Also thank you to the conceirge team.Our 2 bathroom suite had a walk in shower and a tub shower . one suggestion-- tub/showers need hand rail for getting in and out of tub. otherwise perfect hotel for stay in London.We will definitely stay at this hotel again Room Tip: We Liked the Kings building .Has private entrance We stayed there on our previous visit See more room tips

Fantastic stay at this hotel, great location, great service. Was upgraded on arrival and everything was perfect. The staff assisted us with restaurants, attractions, travel tickets, we would definitely stay here again.

I am a huge fan of the Taj hotels having stayed at many around the world. Taj 51 is next door to the Taj St James Court. (Do NOT stay there.....very noisy and awful service). Taj 51 is a gorgeous property with lovely large suites. Our room was a King Suite and had a large bedroom, separate large living room, small modern kitchen, and a reasonable bathroom. (I would have given this hotel 5 stars if the bathroom had been as impressive as the rest of the room, but the bathroom was quite small). The service is fantastic and they were always offering help with transportation, reservations, anything you need. Wifi is free. There is no parking. They offer a full continental and made to order breakfast. My only complaint is that the continental breakfast, although offered a lot of options and was delicious, really wasnt work 20 GBP. It should have been included in the (extremely high) price. The location is PERFECT. It is a 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace; 7 minutes to Clarence house/St James Palace; 15 minute walk to Big Ben/Houses of Parliament/Westminster Abbey; 7 minute drive to Harrods (probably about 25 minute walk); 10 minute walk to Trafalgar Square.......everything is very close. Try the attached, Michelin starred Quinlon restaurant. It is amazing south west Indian food. it is unlike anything you have tried.The flavors are unique with loads of both meat and vegetarian options. Bistro 51 has a great Ahi Tuna Tartar and a lovely afternoon tea. The price to stay here can be VERY high but is expected due to the room size and location. Although this Taj property isnt as nice a some of those located in South Africa and India, it is still a very nice property and will not disappoint. Room Tip: Request a room on a higher level to avoid any noise concerns. See more room tips

I cannot say enough how much my wife and I enjoyed our stay at Taj 51. We were in London for four days celebrating our 15th anniversary and we had not been on a trip since our kids were born over 8 years ago. Without stating the obvious, this was a very special trip for us. You have probably read about the service at the Taj and because we read these with a bit of caution we were slightly skeptical that it would live up to our expectations. Well our expectations were not met, but exceeded with flying colors. We packed about seven days of activities into four and all of this was made so much easier by service unlike any my wife and I have ever enjoyed. From several weeks before our trip to our actual stay in London, the staff was on top of everything. I felt like a pest before our trip by emailing every random question and request and they responded with timely well thoughtout answers that made our trip planning especially effortless. We have been places where the concierge will tell you how do things or help point you in the right direction, but the concierges at the Taj would handle everything from event tickets to train tickets and even dinner reservations. They even knew our names from the moment we stepped in until we left no matter who was on duty. The accommodations were fantastic and they have a really nice canape and drink event nightly and the hotel location is fantastic. Staying at Taj 51 was truly one of the best experiences my wife and I have been apart of.

this hotel never fails to suprise me on each and every visit. the suites are beautiful the staff are charming, helpful and in abundence. we had a fantastic stay. thank you all again we will be returning very soon. if your looking for a flagship hotel in london ypu wont be disapointed.

My wife and I stayed at this hotel to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. We stayed in one of the Minister suites which was simply fantastic. The rooms were equipped with everything that we needed for a 3 day stay. The location was great and the breakfasts were lovely. The staff are so attentive and are a credit to the hotel. We were made to feel extra special and it really added to the weekend. We will definitely stay at this hotel again. I would go as far to say that this hotel is the best in London - Mr Thorpe

Thank you for reviewing your recent stay at Taj 51 Buckingham Gate. I was delighted to read you enjoyed your suite and our famous Taj Service.

The rooms were equipped with everything that we needed for a 3 day stay. The location was great and the breakfasts were lovely. The staff are so attentive and are a credit to the hotel. We were made to feel extra special and it really added to the weekend. We will definitely stay at this hotel again. I would go as far to say that this hotel is the best in London - Mr Thorpe

Dear Mr Thrope. First may I congratulate you both on your 10th Wedding Anniversary. Thank you for sharing your recent stay with us with other Tripadvisors.

The service and the rooms were superb, is our first visit in London and they make this moment unforgetable..! Is close to the sub station, you have all the main attractions from London just by walking, they have a wonderful cafe cross the street, for a good breakfast before the tourist walk.

Thank you for reviewing your recent stay at Taj 51 Buckingham Gate. I was delighted to read you enjoyed your suite and our famous Taj Service. I was pleased to read that your first trip to London and my team created a nice memory for you. We are within walking distant to many attractions around London includling Buckingham Palace, House of Commons, Ben Big and many more and with St. James Park Tube Station only 2 minutes walk away. I hope that your next visit to London we will be able to welcoming you back to Taj London. Best Regards Araceli Ruis-Perez Hotel Manager

We have stayed here often and from our understanding the hotel was taken back by the Taj group following management by another hotel chain. The hotel is synonymous with the Taj chain, which is our favourite chain of hotel and renowned for its superb service. Same for this hotel, service was excellent and surprisingly personal for a hotel of this size. Nothing was too much trouble. We were in a junior suite so there was plenty of room with TVs in both rooms. Beautiful courtyard with a fountain. Luckily the weather was great and we were able to enjoy lunches out there. Wifi excellent â free and fast. Perfect location and walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Big Ben, Green Park, St James Park, Victoria, Piccadilly and many other top spots. The tube station is just around the corner. Highly recommended

We stayed here with two of our close friends and stayed in the minister suites ... They were apartments!! So amazing and nothing was too much trouble.. The drinks in the court yard were great and a lovely touch with canapÃ©s Everything was so comfy and welcoming... TV in the bath!! Wow!! We went for breakfast in the morning and was the best I've tasted! Also the extras of smoked salmon, avocado and much more! Really was the best hotel we have stayed in!! Thank you to the staff that made us feel so welcome

Thank you for taking the time to write about your recent stay at Taj 51 Buckingham Gate. I am delighted you enjoyed your suite in Minsters and the facilities within the suite. Our Complimentry Drinks and Canapes are very popular with our guest and pleased you were able to join us. We do hope that we will have the pleasure of welcoming back again soon. Kind Regards Araceli Ruis-Perez Hotel Manager

We have just returned from a perfect weekend trip for our Anniversary. We arrived on Friday and were very impressed with the location and the "look" of the hotel, especially the beautiful courtyard. It is a five minute walk from the tube and is in such a great place for all the best sight-seeing in London. The area was quiet and felt very safe. From the first moments, the staff at 51 Buckingham Gate made us feel like we had arrived somewhere very special indeed. Their attentiveness and courtesy are what we will remember most about our stay. We were upgraded to a 2 bedroom apartment (falconers) on the seventh floor, with stunning views. It had everything we needed and Sergio, the concierge, showed us everything in the room and gave us lots of info about amenities in the local area. We only ate breakfast at the hotel, which was excellent both days. A fantastic selection and again the service was first class, especially Errol and Georgio. The complimentary canapÃ©s and drinks in the library each evening were a really nice treat and we spent a lovely evening in the company of the two waiters from Hungary and Spain, who were so attentive and great to chat to. We can't wait to return to the hotel - we were treated royally by everyone we met and were made to feel truly "at home". Thank you to all at 51 Buckingham Gate for making our Anniversary so very special. Room Tip: The views from the seventh floor were fantastic. See more room tips

Stayed at this hotel for the 4th time This time we were in a two bedroom apartment in Falconers Building Usual excellent service from staff. Special thanks to Erol and Eva in breakfast room for all their care and attention to us and granddaughters. Also thank you to the conceirge team.Our 2 bathroom suite had a walk in shower and a tub shower . one suggestion-- tub/showers need hand rail for getting in and out of tub. otherwise perfect hotel for stay in London.We will definitely stay at this hotel again Room Tip: We Liked the Kings building .Has private entrance We stayed there on our previous visit See more room tips

Fantastic stay at this hotel, great location, great service. Was upgraded on arrival and everything was perfect. The staff assisted us with restaurants, attractions, travel tickets, we would definitely stay here again.

I am a huge fan of the Taj hotels having stayed at many around the world. Taj 51 is next door to the Taj St James Court. (Do NOT stay there.....very noisy and awful service). Taj 51 is a gorgeous property with lovely large suites. Our room was a King Suite and had a large bedroom, separate large living room, small modern kitchen, and a reasonable bathroom. (I would have given this hotel 5 stars if the bathroom had been as impressive as the rest of the room, but the bathroom was quite small). The service is fantastic and they were always offering help with transportation, reservations, anything you need. Wifi is free. There is no parking. They offer a full continental and made to order breakfast. My only complaint is that the continental breakfast, although offered a lot of options and was delicious, really wasnt work 20 GBP. It should have been included in the (extremely high) price. The location is PERFECT. It is a 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace; 7 minutes to Clarence house/St James Palace; 15 minute walk to Big Ben/Houses of Parliament/Westminster Abbey; 7 minute drive to Harrods (probably about 25 minute walk); 10 minute walk to Trafalgar Square.......everything is very close. Try the attached, Michelin starred Quinlon restaurant. It is amazing south west Indian food. it is unlike anything you have tried.The flavors are unique with loads of both meat and vegetarian options. Bistro 51 has a great Ahi Tuna Tartar and a lovely afternoon tea. The price to stay here can be VERY high but is expected due to the room size and location. Although this Taj property isnt as nice a some of those located in South Africa and India, it is still a very nice property and will not disappoint. Room Tip: Request a room on a higher level to avoid any noise concerns. See more room tips

I cannot say enough how much my wife and I enjoyed our stay at Taj 51. We were in London for four days celebrating our 15th anniversary and we had not been on a trip since our kids were born over 8 years ago. Without stating the obvious, this was a very special trip for us. You have probably read about the service at the Taj and because we read these with a bit of caution we were slightly skeptical that it would live up to our expectations. Well our expectations were not met, but exceeded with flying colors. We packed about seven days of activities into four and all of this was made so much easier by service unlike any my wife and I have ever enjoyed. From several weeks before our trip to our actual stay in London, the staff was on top of everything. I felt like a pest before our trip by emailing every random question and request and they responded with timely well thoughtout answers that made our trip planning especially effortless. We have been places where the concierge will tell you how do things or help point you in the right direction, but the concierges at the Taj would handle everything from event tickets to train tickets and even dinner reservations. They even knew our names from the moment we stepped in until we left no matter who was on duty. The accommodations were fantastic and they have a really nice canape and drink event nightly and the hotel location is fantastic. Staying at Taj 51 was truly one of the best experiences my wife and I have been apart of.

Room Tip: Request a room on a higher level to avoid any noise concerns. See more room tips

I cannot say enough how much my wife and I enjoyed our stay at Taj 51. We were in London for four days celebrating our 15th anniversary and we had not been on a trip since our kids were born over 8 years ago. Without stating the obvious, this was a very special trip for us. You have probably read about the service at the Taj and because we read these with a bit of caution we were slightly skeptical that it would live up to our expectations. Well our expectations were not met, but exceeded with flying colors. We packed about seven days of activities into four and all of this was made so much easier by service unlike any my wife and I have ever enjoyed. From several weeks before our trip to our actual stay in London, the staff was on top of everything. I felt like a pest before our trip by emailing every random question and request and they responded with timely well thoughtout answers that made our trip planning especially effortless. We have been places where the concierge will tell you how do things or help point you in the right direction, but the concierges at the Taj would handle everything from event tickets to train tickets and even dinner reservations. They even knew our names from the moment we stepped in until we left no matter who was on duty. The accommodations were fantastic and they have a really nice canape and drink event nightly and the hotel location is fantastic. Staying at Taj 51 was truly one of the best experiences my wife and I have been apart of.

this hotel never fails to suprise me on each and every visit. the suites are beautiful the staff are charming, helpful and in abundence. we had a fantastic stay. thank you all again we will be returning very soon. if your looking for a flagship hotel in london ypu wont be disapointed.

My wife and I stayed at this hotel to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. We stayed in one of the Minister suites which was simply fantastic. The rooms were equipped with everything that we needed for a 3 day stay. The location was great and the breakfasts were lovely. The staff are so attentive and are a credit to the hotel. We were made to feel extra special and it really added to the weekend. We will definitely stay at this hotel again. I would go as far to say that this hotel is the best in London - Mr Thorpe

The service and the rooms were superb, is our first visit in London and they make this moment unforgetable..! Is close to the sub station, you have all the main attractions from London just by walking, they have a wonderful cafe cross the street, for a good breakfast before the tourist walk.

Thank you for reviewing your recent stay at Taj 51 Buckingham Gate. I was delighted to read you enjoyed your suite and our famous Taj Service. I was pleased to read that your first trip to London and my team created a nice memory for you. We are within walking distant to many attractions around London includling Buckingham Palace, House of Commons, Ben Big and many more and with St. James Park Tube Station only 2 minutes walk away. I hope that your next visit to London we will be able to welcoming you back to Taj London. Best Regards Araceli Ruis-Perez Hotel Manager

We have stayed here often and from our understanding the hotel was taken back by the Taj group following management by another hotel chain. The hotel is synonymous with the Taj chain, which is our favourite chain of hotel and renowned for its superb service. Same for this hotel, service was excellent and surprisingly personal for a hotel of this size. Nothing was too much trouble. We were in a junior suite so there was plenty of room with TVs in both rooms. Beautiful courtyard with a fountain. Luckily the weather was great and we were able to enjoy lunches out there. Wifi excellent â free and fast. Perfect location and walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Big Ben, Green Park, St James Park, Victoria, Piccadilly and many other top spots. The tube station is just around the corner. Highly recommended

We stayed here with two of our close friends and stayed in the minister suites ... They were apartments!! So amazing and nothing was too much trouble.. The drinks in the court yard were great and a lovely touch with canapÃ©s Everything was so comfy and welcoming... TV in the bath!! Wow!! We went for breakfast in the morning and was the best I've tasted! Also the extras of smoked salmon, avocado and much more! Really was the best hotel we have stayed in!! Thank you to the staff that made us feel so welcome

Thank you for taking the time to write about your recent stay at Taj 51 Buckingham Gate. I am delighted you enjoyed your suite in Minsters and the facilities within the suite. Our Complimentry Drinks and Canapes are very popular with our guest and pleased you were able to join us. We do hope that we will have the pleasure of welcoming back again soon. Kind Regards Araceli Ruis-Perez Hotel Manager

We have just returned from a perfect weekend trip for our Anniversary. We arrived on Friday and were very impressed with the location and the "look" of the hotel, especially the beautiful courtyard. It is a five minute walk from the tube and is in such a great place for all the best sight-seeing in London. The area was quiet and felt very safe. From the first moments, the staff at 51 Buckingham Gate made us feel like we had arrived somewhere very special indeed. Their attentiveness and courtesy are what we will remember most about our stay. We were upgraded to a 2 bedroom apartment (falconers) on the seventh floor, with stunning views. It had everything we needed and Sergio, the concierge, showed us everything in the room and gave us lots of info about amenities in the local area. We only ate breakfast at the hotel, which was excellent both days. A fantastic selection and again the service was first class, especially Errol and Georgio. The complimentary canapÃ©s and drinks in the library each evening were a really nice treat and we spent a lovely evening in the company of the two waiters from Hungary and Spain, who were so attentive and great to chat to. We can't wait to return to the hotel - we were treated royally by everyone we met and were made to feel truly "at home". Thank you to all at 51 Buckingham Gate for making our Anniversary so very special. Room Tip: The views from the seventh floor were fantastic. See more room tips

Stayed at this hotel for the 4th time This time we were in a two bedroom apartment in Falconers Building Usual excellent service from staff. Special thanks to Erol and Eva in breakfast room for all their care and attention to us and granddaughters. Also thank you to the conceirge team.Our 2 bathroom suite had a walk in shower and a tub shower . one suggestion-- tub/showers need hand rail for getting in and out of tub. otherwise perfect hotel for stay in London.We will definitely stay at this hotel again Room Tip: We Liked the Kings building .Has private entrance We stayed there on our previous visit See more room tips

Fantastic stay at this hotel, great location, great service. Was upgraded on arrival and everything was perfect. The staff assisted us with restaurants, attractions, travel tickets, we would definitely stay here again.

I am a huge fan of the Taj hotels having stayed at many around the world. Taj 51 is next door to the Taj St James Court. (Do NOT stay there.....very noisy and awful service). Taj 51 is a gorgeous property with lovely large suites. Our room was a King Suite and had a large bedroom, separate large living room, small modern kitchen, and a reasonable bathroom. (I would have given this hotel 5 stars if the bathroom had been as impressive as the rest of the room, but the bathroom was quite small). The service is fantastic and they were always offering help with transportation, reservations, anything you need. Wifi is free. There is no parking. They offer a full continental and made to order breakfast. My only complaint is that the continental breakfast, although offered a lot of options and was delicious, really wasnt work 20 GBP. It should have been included in the (extremely high) price. The location is PERFECT. It is a 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace; 7 minutes to Clarence house/St James Palace; 15 minute walk to Big Ben/Houses of Parliament/Westminster Abbey; 7 minute drive to Harrods (probably about 25 minute walk); 10 minute walk to Trafalgar Square.......everything is very close. Try the attached, Michelin starred Quinlon restaurant. It is amazing south west Indian food. it is unlike anything you have tried.The flavors are unique with loads of both meat and vegetarian options. Bistro 51 has a great Ahi Tuna Tartar and a lovely afternoon tea. The price to stay here can be VERY high but is expected due to the room size and location. Although this Taj property isnt as nice a some of those located in South Africa and India, it is still a very nice property and will not disappoint.

Fantastic stay at this hotel, great location, great service. Was upgraded on arrival and everything was perfect. The staff assisted us with restaurants, attractions, travel tickets, we would definitely stay here again.

I am a huge fan of the Taj hotels having stayed at many around the world. Taj 51 is next door to the Taj St James Court. (Do NOT stay there.....very noisy and awful service). Taj 51 is a gorgeous property with lovely large suites. Our room was a King Suite and had a large bedroom, separate large living room, small modern kitchen, and a reasonable bathroom. (I would have given this hotel 5 stars if the bathroom had been as impressive as the rest of the room, but the bathroom was quite small). The service is fantastic and they were always offering help with transportation, reservations, anything you need. Wifi is free. There is no parking. They offer a full continental and made to order breakfast. My only complaint is that the continental breakfast, although offered a lot of options and was delicious, really wasnt work 20 GBP. It should have been included in the (extremely high) price. The location is PERFECT. It is a 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace; 7 minutes to Clarence house/St James Palace; 15 minute walk to Big Ben/Houses of Parliament/Westminster Abbey; 7 minute drive to Harrods (probably about 25 minute walk); 10 minute walk to Trafalgar Square.......everything is very close. Try the attached, Michelin starred Quinlon restaurant. It is amazing south west Indian food. it is unlike anything you have tried.The flavors are unique with loads of both meat and vegetarian options. Bistro 51 has a great Ahi Tuna Tartar and a lovely afternoon tea. The price to stay here can be VERY high but is expected due to the room size and location. Although this Taj property isnt as nice a some of those located in South Africa and India, it is still a very nice property and will not disappoint. Room Tip: Request a room on a higher level to avoid any noise concerns. See more room tips

I cannot say enough how much my wife and I enjoyed our stay at Taj 51. We were in London for four days celebrating our 15th anniversary and we had not been on a trip since our kids were born over 8 years ago. Without stating the obvious, this was a very special trip for us. You have probably read about the service at the Taj and because we read these with a bit of caution we were slightly skeptical that it would live up to our expectations. Well our expectations were not met, but exceeded with flying colors. We packed about seven days of activities into four and all of this was made so much easier by service unlike any my wife and I have ever enjoyed. From several weeks before our trip to our actual stay in London, the staff was on top of everything. I felt like a pest before our trip by emailing every random question and request and they responded with timely well thoughtout answers that made our trip planning especially effortless. We have been places where the concierge will tell you how do things or help point you in the right direction, but the concierges at the Taj would handle everything from event tickets to train tickets and even dinner reservations. They even knew our names from the moment we stepped in until we left no matter who was on duty. The accommodations were fantastic and they have a really nice canape and drink event nightly and the hotel location is fantastic. Staying at Taj 51 was truly one of the best experiences my wife and I have been apart of.

this hotel never fails to suprise me on each and every visit. the suites are beautiful the staff are charming, helpful and in abundence. we had a fantastic stay. thank you all again we will be returning very soon. if your looking for a flagship hotel in london ypu wont be disapointed.

My wife and I stayed at this hotel to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. We stayed in one of the Minister suites which was simply fantastic. The rooms were equipped with everything that we needed for a 3 day stay. The location was great and the breakfasts were lovely. The staff are so attentive and are a credit to the hotel. We were made to feel extra special and it really added to the weekend. We will definitely stay at this hotel again. I would go as far to say that this hotel is the best in London - Mr Thorpe

Dear Mr Thrope. First may I congratulate you both on your 10th Wedding Anniversary. Thank you for sharing your recent stay with us with other Tripadvisors.

It is always wonderful to hear such positive feedback, which serves as a great motivator to my team. We look forward to wecolming you back again soon. Best Regards Araceli Ruis-Perez Hotel Manager

The service and the rooms were superb, is our first visit in London and they make this moment unforgetable..! Is close to the sub station, you have all the main attractions from London just by walking, they have a wonderful cafe cross the street, for a good breakfast before the tourist walk.

Thank you for reviewing your recent stay at Taj 51 Buckingham Gate. I was delighted to read you enjoyed your suite and our famous Taj Service. I was pleased to read that your first trip to London and my team created a nice memory for you. We are within walking distant to many attractions around London includling Buckingham Palace, House of Commons, Ben Big and many more and with St. James Park Tube Station only 2 minutes walk away. I hope that your next visit to London we will be able to welcoming you back to Taj London. Best Regards Araceli Ruis-Perez Hotel Manager

We have stayed here often and from our understanding the hotel was taken back by the Taj group following management by another hotel chain. The hotel is synonymous with the Taj chain, which is our favourite chain of hotel and renowned for its superb service. Same for this hotel, service was excellent and surprisingly personal for a hotel of this size. Nothing was too much trouble. We were in a junior suite so there was plenty of room with TVs in both rooms. Beautiful courtyard with a fountain. Luckily the weather was great and we were able to enjoy lunches out there. Wifi excellent â free and fast. Perfect location and walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Big Ben, Green Park, St James Park, Victoria, Piccadilly and many other top spots. The tube station is just around the corner. Highly recommended

We stayed here with two of our close friends and stayed in the minister suites ... They were apartments!! So amazing and nothing was too much trouble.. The drinks in the court yard were great and a lovely touch with canapÃ©s Everything was so comfy and welcoming... TV in the bath!! Wow!! We went for breakfast in the morning and was the best I've tasted! Also the extras of smoked salmon, avocado and much more! Really was the best hotel we have stayed in!! Thank you to the staff that made us feel so welcome

Thank you for taking the time to write about your recent stay at Taj 51 Buckingham Gate. I am delighted you enjoyed your suite in Minsters and the facilities within the suite. Our Complimentry Drinks and Canapes are very popular with our guest and pleased you were able to join us. We do hope that we will have the pleasure of welcoming back again soon. Kind Regards Araceli Ruis-Perez Hotel Manager

We have just returned from a perfect weekend trip for our Anniversary. We arrived on Friday and were very impressed with the location and the "look" of the hotel, especially the beautiful courtyard. It is a five minute walk from the tube and is in such a great place for all the best sight-seeing in London. The area was quiet and felt very safe. From the first moments, the staff at 51 Buckingham Gate made us feel like we had arrived somewhere very special indeed. Their attentiveness and courtesy are what we will remember most about our stay. We were upgraded to a 2 bedroom apartment (falconers) on the seventh floor, with stunning views. It had everything we needed and Sergio, the concierge, showed us everything in the room and gave us lots of info about amenities in the local area. We only ate breakfast at the hotel, which was excellent both days. A fantastic selection and again the service was first class, especially Errol and Georgio. The complimentary canapÃ©s and drinks in the library each evening were a really nice treat and we spent a lovely evening in the company of the two waiters from Hungary and Spain, who were so attentive and great to chat to. We can't wait to return to the hotel - we were treated royally by everyone we met and were made to feel truly "at home". Thank you to all at 51 Buckingham Gate for making our Anniversary so very special. Room Tip: The views from the seventh floor were fantastic. See more room tips

We have just returned from a perfect weekend trip for our Anniversary. We arrived on Friday and were very impressed with the location and the "look" of the hotel, especially the beautiful courtyard. It is a five minute walk from the tube and is in such a great place for all the best sight-seeing in London. The area was quiet and felt very safe. From the first moments, the staff at 51 Buckingham Gate made us feel like we had arrived somewhere very special indeed. Their attentiveness and courtesy are what we will remember most about our stay. We were upgraded to a 2 bedroom apartment (falconers) on the seventh floor, with stunning views. It had everything we needed and Sergio, the concierge, showed us everything in the room and gave us lots of info about amenities in the local area. We only ate breakfast at the hotel, which was excellent both days. A fantastic selection and again the service was first class, especially Errol and Georgio. The complimentary canapÃ©s and drinks in the library each evening were a really nice treat and we spent a lovely evening in the company of the two waiters from Hungary and Spain, who were so attentive and great to chat to. We can't wait to return to the hotel - we were treated royally by everyone we met and were made to feel truly "at home". Thank you to all at 51 Buckingham Gate for making our Anniversary so very special. Room Tip: The views from the seventh floor were fantastic. See more room tips

Stayed at this hotel for the 4th time This time we were in a two bedroom apartment in Falconers Building Usual excellent service from staff. Special thanks to Erol and Eva in breakfast room for all their care and attention to us and granddaughters. Also thank you to the conceirge team.Our 2 bathroom suite had a walk in shower and a tub shower . one suggestion-- tub/showers need hand rail for getting in and out of tub. otherwise perfect hotel for stay in London.We will definitely stay at this hotel again Room Tip: We Liked the Kings building .Has private entrance We stayed there on our previous visit See more room tips

Fantastic stay at this hotel, great location, great service. Was upgraded on arrival and everything was perfect. The staff assisted us with restaurants, attractions, travel tickets, we would definitely stay here again.

I am a huge fan of the Taj hotels having stayed at many around the world. Taj 51 is next door to the Taj St James Court. (Do NOT stay there.....very noisy and awful service). Taj 51 is a gorgeous property with lovely large suites. Our room was a King Suite and had a large bedroom, separate large living room, small modern kitchen, and a reasonable bathroom. (I would have given this hotel 5 stars if the bathroom had been as impressive as the rest of the room, but the bathroom was quite small). The service is fantastic and they were always offering help with transportation, reservations, anything you need. Wifi is free. There is no parking. They offer a full continental and made to order breakfast. My only complaint is that the continental breakfast, although offered a lot of options and was delicious, really wasnt work 20 GBP. It should have been included in the (extremely high) price. The location is PERFECT. It is a 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace; 7 minutes to Clarence house/St James Palace; 15 minute walk to Big Ben/Houses of Parliament/Westminster Abbey; 7 minute drive to Harrods (probably about 25 minute walk); 10 minute walk to Trafalgar Square.......everything is very close. Try the attached, Michelin starred Quinlon restaurant. It is amazing south west Indian food. it is unlike anything you have tried.The flavors are unique with loads of both meat and vegetarian options. Bistro 51 has a great Ahi Tuna Tartar and a lovely afternoon tea. The price to stay here can be VERY high but is expected due to the room size and location. Although this Taj property isnt as nice a some of those located in South Africa and India, it is still a very nice property and will not disappoint. Room Tip: Request a room on a higher level to avoid any noise concerns. See more room tips

I cannot say enough how much my wife and I enjoyed our stay at Taj 51. We were in London for four days celebrating our 15th anniversary and we had not been on a trip since our kids were born over 8 years ago. Without stating the obvious, this was a very special trip for us. You have probably read about the service at the Taj and because we read these with a bit of caution we were slightly skeptical that it would live up to our expectations. Well our expectations were not met, but exceeded with flying colors. We packed about seven days of activities into four and all of this was made so much easier by service unlike any my wife and I have ever enjoyed. From several weeks before our trip to our actual stay in London, the staff was on top of everything. I felt like a pest before our trip by emailing every random question and request and they responded with timely well thoughtout answers that made our trip planning especially effortless. We have been places where the concierge will tell you how do things or help point you in the right direction, but the concierges at the Taj would handle everything from event tickets to train tickets and even dinner reservations. They even knew our names from the moment we stepped in until we left no matter who was on duty. The accommodations were fantastic and they have a really nice canape and drink event nightly and the hotel location is fantastic. Staying at Taj 51 was truly one of the best experiences my wife and I have been apart of.

this hotel never fails to suprise me on each and every visit. the suites are beautiful the staff are charming, helpful and in abundence. we had a fantastic stay. thank you all again we will be returning very soon. if your looking for a flagship hotel in london ypu wont be disapointed.

My wife and I stayed at this hotel to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. We stayed in one of the Minister suites which was simply fantastic. The rooms were equipped with everything that we needed for a 3 day stay. The location was great and the breakfasts were lovely. The staff are so attentive and are a credit to the hotel. We were made to feel extra special and it really added to the weekend. We will definitely stay at this hotel again. I would go as far to say that this hotel is the best in London - Mr Thorpe

The service and the rooms were superb, is our first visit in London and they make this moment unforgetable..! Is close to the sub station, you have all the main attractions from London just by walking, they have a wonderful cafe cross the street, for a good breakfast before the tourist walk.

Thank you for reviewing your recent stay at Taj 51 Buckingham Gate. I was delighted to read you enjoyed your suite and our famous Taj Service.

I hope that your next visit to London we will be able to welcoming you back to Taj London. Best Regards Araceli Ruis-Perez Hotel Manager

We have stayed here often and from our understanding the hotel was taken back by the Taj group following management by another hotel chain. The hotel is synonymous with the Taj chain, which is our favourite chain of hotel and renowned for its superb service. Same for this hotel, service was excellent and surprisingly personal for a hotel of this size. Nothing was too much trouble. We were in a junior suite so there was plenty of room with TVs in both rooms. Beautiful courtyard with a fountain. Luckily the weather was great and we were able to enjoy lunches out there. Wifi excellent â free and fast. Perfect location and walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Big Ben, Green Park, St James Park, Victoria, Piccadilly and many other top spots. The tube station is just around the corner. Highly recommended

We stayed here with two of our close friends and stayed in the minister suites ... They were apartments!! So amazing and nothing was too much trouble.. The drinks in the court yard were great and a lovely touch with canapÃ©s Everything was so comfy and welcoming... TV in the bath!! Wow!! We went for breakfast in the morning and was the best I've tasted! Also the extras of smoked salmon, avocado and much more! Really was the best hotel we have stayed in!! Thank you to the staff that made us feel so welcome

I hope that your next visit to London we will be able to welcoming you back to Taj London. Best Regards Araceli Ruis-Perez Hotel Manager

We have stayed here often and from our understanding the hotel was taken back by the Taj group following management by another hotel chain. The hotel is synonymous with the Taj chain, which is our favourite chain of hotel and renowned for its superb service. Same for this hotel, service was excellent and surprisingly personal for a hotel of this size. Nothing was too much trouble. We were in a junior suite so there was plenty of room with TVs in both rooms. Beautiful courtyard with a fountain. Luckily the weather was great and we were able to enjoy lunches out there. Wifi excellent â free and fast. Perfect location and walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Big Ben, Green Park, St James Park, Victoria, Piccadilly and many other top spots. The tube station is just around the corner. Highly recommended

We stayed here with two of our close friends and stayed in the minister suites ... They were apartments!! So amazing and nothing was too much trouble.. The drinks in the court yard were great and a lovely touch with canapÃ©s Everything was so comfy and welcoming... TV in the bath!! Wow!! We went for breakfast in the morning and was the best I've tasted! Also the extras of smoked salmon, avocado and much more! Really was the best hotel we have stayed in!! Thank you to the staff that made us feel so welcome

Thank you for taking the time to write about your recent stay at Taj 51 Buckingham Gate. I am delighted you enjoyed your suite in Minsters and the facilities within the suite. Our Complimentry Drinks and Canapes are very popular with our guest and pleased you were able to join us. We do hope that we will have the pleasure of welcoming back again soon.

We have just returned from a perfect weekend trip for our Anniversary. We arrived on Friday and were very impressed with the location and the "look" of the hotel, especially the beautiful courtyard. It is a five minute walk from the tube and is in such a great place for all the best sight-seeing in London. The area was quiet and felt very safe. From the first moments, the staff at 51 Buckingham Gate made us feel like we had arrived somewhere very special indeed. Their attentiveness and courtesy are what we will remember most about our stay. We were upgraded to a 2 bedroom apartment (falconers) on the seventh floor, with stunning views. It had everything we needed and Sergio, the concierge, showed us everything in the room and gave us lots of info about amenities in the local area. We only ate breakfast at the hotel, which was excellent both days. A fantastic selection and again the service was first class, especially Errol and Georgio. The complimentary canapÃ©s and drinks in the library each evening were a really nice treat and we spent a lovely evening in the company of the two waiters from Hungary and Spain, who were so attentive and great to chat to. We can't wait to return to the hotel - we were treated royally by everyone we met and were made to feel truly "at home". Thank you to all at 51 Buckingham Gate for making our Anniversary so very special. Room Tip: The views from the seventh floor were fantastic. See more room tips

Stayed at this hotel for the 4th time This time we were in a two bedroom apartment in Falconers Building Usual excellent service from staff. Special thanks to Erol and Eva in breakfast room for all their care and attention to us and granddaughters. Also thank you to the conceirge team.Our 2 bathroom suite had a walk in shower and a tub shower . one suggestion-- tub/showers need hand rail for getting in and out of tub. otherwise perfect hotel for stay in London.We will definitely stay at this hotel again Room Tip: We Liked the Kings building .Has private entrance We stayed there on our previous visit See more room tips

Fantastic stay at this hotel, great location, great service. Was upgraded on arrival and everything was perfect. The staff assisted us with restaurants, attractions, travel tickets, we would definitely stay here again.

I am a huge fan of the Taj hotels having stayed at many around the world. Taj 51 is next door to the Taj St James Court. (Do NOT stay there.....very noisy and awful service). Taj 51 is a gorgeous property with lovely large suites. Our room was a King Suite and had a large bedroom, separate large living room, small modern kitchen, and a reasonable bathroom. (I would have given this hotel 5 stars if the bathroom had been as impressive as the rest of the room, but the bathroom was quite small). The service is fantastic and they were always offering help with transportation, reservations, anything you need. Wifi is free. There is no parking. They offer a full continental and made to order breakfast. My only complaint is that the continental breakfast, although offered a lot of options and was delicious, really wasnt work 20 GBP. It should have been included in the (extremely high) price. The location is PERFECT. It is a 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace; 7 minutes to Clarence house/St James Palace; 15 minute walk to Big Ben/Houses of Parliament/Westminster Abbey; 7 minute drive to Harrods (probably about 25 minute walk); 10 minute walk to Trafalgar Square.......everything is very close. Try the attached, Michelin starred Quinlon restaurant. It is amazing south west Indian food. it is unlike anything you have tried.The flavors are unique with loads of both meat and vegetarian options. Bistro 51 has a great Ahi Tuna Tartar and a lovely afternoon tea. The price to stay here can be VERY high but is expected due to the room size and location. Although this Taj property isnt as nice a some of those located in South Africa and India, it is still a very nice property and will not disappoint. Room Tip: Request a room on a higher level to avoid any noise concerns. See more room tips

I cannot say enough how much my wife and I enjoyed our stay at Taj 51. We were in London for four days celebrating our 15th anniversary and we had not been on a trip since our kids were born over 8 years ago. Without stating the obvious, this was a very special trip for us. You have probably read about the service at the Taj and because we read these with a bit of caution we were slightly skeptical that it would live up to our expectations. Well our expectations were not met, but exceeded with flying colors. We packed about seven days of activities into four and all of this was made so much easier by service unlike any my wife and I have ever enjoyed. From several weeks before our trip to our actual stay in London, the staff was on top of everything. I felt like a pest before our trip by emailing every random question and request and they responded with timely well thoughtout answers that made our trip planning especially effortless. We have been places where the concierge will tell you how do things or help point you in the right direction, but the concierges at the Taj would handle everything from event tickets to train tickets and even dinner reservations. They even knew our names from the moment we stepped in until we left no matter who was on duty. The accommodations were fantastic and they have a really nice canape and drink event nightly and the hotel location is fantastic. Staying at Taj 51 was truly one of the best experiences my wife and I have been apart of.

this hotel never fails to suprise me on each and every visit. the suites are beautiful the staff are charming, helpful and in abundence. we had a fantastic stay. thank you all again we will be returning very soon. if your looking for a flagship hotel in london ypu wont be disapointed.

My wife and I stayed at this hotel to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. We stayed in one of the Minister suites which was simply fantastic. The rooms were equipped with everything that we needed for a 3 day stay. The location was great and the breakfasts were lovely. The staff are so attentive and are a credit to the hotel. We were made to feel extra special and it really added to the weekend. We will definitely stay at this hotel again. I would go as far to say that this hotel is the best in London - Mr Thorpe

My wife and I stayed at this hotel to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. We stayed in one of the Minister suites which was simply fantastic. The rooms were equipped with everything that we needed for a 3 day stay. The location was great and the breakfasts were lovely. The staff are so attentive and are a credit to the hotel. We were made to feel extra special and it really added to the weekend. We will definitely stay at this hotel again. I would go as far to say that this hotel is the best in London - Mr Thorpe

The service and the rooms were superb, is our first visit in London and they make this moment unforgetable..! Is close to the sub station, you have all the main attractions from London just by walking, they have a wonderful cafe cross the street, for a good breakfast before the tourist walk.

Thank you for reviewing your recent stay at Taj 51 Buckingham Gate. I was delighted to read you enjoyed your suite and our famous Taj Service. I was pleased to read that your first trip to London and my team created a nice memory for you. We are within walking distant to many attractions around London includling Buckingham Palace, House of Commons, Ben Big and many more and with St. James Park Tube Station only 2 minutes walk away. I hope that your next visit to London we will be able to welcoming you back to Taj London. Best Regards Araceli Ruis-Perez Hotel Manager

We have stayed here often and from our understanding the hotel was taken back by the Taj group following management by another hotel chain. The hotel is synonymous with the Taj chain, which is our favourite chain of hotel and renowned for its superb service. Same for this hotel, service was excellent and surprisingly personal for a hotel of this size. Nothing was too much trouble. We were in a junior suite so there was plenty of room with TVs in both rooms. Beautiful courtyard with a fountain. Luckily the weather was great and we were able to enjoy lunches out there. Wifi excellent â free and fast. Perfect location and walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Big Ben, Green Park, St James Park, Victoria, Piccadilly and many other top spots. The tube station is just around the corner. Highly recommended

We stayed here with two of our close friends and stayed in the minister suites ... They were apartments!! So amazing and nothing was too much trouble.. The drinks in the court yard were great and a lovely touch with canapÃ©s Everything was so comfy and welcoming... TV in the bath!! Wow!! We went for breakfast in the morning and was the best I've tasted! Also the extras of smoked salmon, avocado and much more! Really was the best hotel we have stayed in!! Thank you to the staff that made us feel so welcome

Thank you for taking the time to write about your recent stay at Taj 51 Buckingham Gate. I am delighted you enjoyed your suite in Minsters and the facilities within the suite. Our Complimentry Drinks and Canapes are very popular with our guest and pleased you were able to join us. We do hope that we will have the pleasure of welcoming back again soon. Kind Regards Araceli Ruis-Perez Hotel Manager

We have just returned from a perfect weekend trip for our Anniversary. We arrived on Friday and were very impressed with the location and the "look" of the hotel, especially the beautiful courtyard. It is a five minute walk from the tube and is in such a great place for all the best sight-seeing in London. The area was quiet and felt very safe. From the first moments, the staff at 51 Buckingham Gate made us feel like we had arrived somewhere very special indeed. Their attentiveness and courtesy are what we will remember most about our stay. We were upgraded to a 2 bedroom apartment (falconers) on the seventh floor, with stunning views. It had everything we needed and Sergio, the concierge, showed us everything in the room and gave us lots of info about amenities in the local area. We only ate breakfast at the hotel, which was excellent both days. A fantastic selection and again the service was first class, especially Errol and Georgio. The complimentary canapÃ©s and drinks in the library each evening were a really nice treat and we spent a lovely evening in the company of the two waiters from Hungary and Spain, who were so attentive and great to chat to. We can't wait to return to the hotel - we were treated royally by everyone we met and were made to feel truly "at home". Thank you to all at 51 Buckingham Gate for making our Anniversary so very special. Room Tip: The views from the seventh floor were fantastic. See more room tips

Stayed at this hotel for the 4th time This time we were in a two bedroom apartment in Falconers Building Usual excellent service from staff. Special thanks to Erol and Eva in breakfast room for all their care and attention to us and granddaughters. Also thank you to the conceirge team.Our 2 bathroom suite had a walk in shower and a tub shower . one suggestion-- tub/showers need hand rail for getting in and out of tub. otherwise perfect hotel for stay in London.We will definitely stay at this hotel again Room Tip: We Liked the Kings building .Has private entrance We stayed there on our previous visit See more room tips

Fantastic stay at this hotel, great location, great service. Was upgraded on arrival and everything was perfect. The staff assisted us with restaurants, attractions, travel tickets, we would definitely stay here again.

I am a huge fan of the Taj hotels having stayed at many around the world. Taj 51 is next door to the Taj St James Court. (Do NOT stay there.....very noisy and awful service). Taj 51 is a gorgeous property with lovely large suites. Our room was a King Suite and had a large bedroom, separate large living room, small modern kitchen, and a reasonable bathroom. (I would have given this hotel 5 stars if the bathroom had been as impressive as the rest of the room, but the bathroom was quite small). The service is fantastic and they were always offering help with transportation, reservations, anything you need. Wifi is free. There is no parking. They offer a full continental and made to order breakfast. My only complaint is that the continental breakfast, although offered a lot of options and was delicious, really wasnt work 20 GBP. It should have been included in the (extremely high) price. The location is PERFECT. It is a 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace; 7 minutes to Clarence house/St James Palace; 15 minute walk to Big Ben/Houses of Parliament/Westminster Abbey; 7 minute drive to Harrods (probably about 25 minute walk); 10 minute walk to Trafalgar Square.......everything is very close. Try the attached, Michelin starred Quinlon restaurant. It is amazing south west Indian food. it is unlike anything you have tried.The flavors are unique with loads of both meat and vegetarian options. Bistro 51 has a great Ahi Tuna Tartar and a lovely afternoon tea. The price to stay here can be VERY high but is expected due to the room size and location. Although this Taj property isnt as nice a some of those located in South Africa and India, it is still a very nice property and will not disappoint. Room Tip: Request a room on a higher level to avoid any noise concerns. See more room tips

I cannot say enough how much my wife and I enjoyed our stay at Taj 51. We were in London for four days celebrating our 15th anniversary and we had not been on a trip since our kids were born over 8 years ago. Without stating the obvious, this was a very special trip for us. You have probably read about the service at the Taj and because we read these with a bit of caution we were slightly skeptical that it would live up to our expectations. Well our expectations were not met, but exceeded with flying colors. We packed about seven days of activities into four and all of this was made so much easier by service unlike any my wife and I have ever enjoyed. From several weeks before our trip to our actual stay in London, the staff was on top of everything. I felt like a pest before our trip by emailing every random question and request and they responded with timely well thoughtout answers that made our trip planning especially effortless. We have been places where the concierge will tell you how do things or help point you in the right direction, but the concierges at the Taj would handle everything from event tickets to train tickets and even dinner reservations. They even knew our names from the moment we stepped in until we left no matter who was on duty. The accommodations were fantastic and they have a really nice canape and drink event nightly and the hotel location is fantastic. Staying at Taj 51 was truly one of the best experiences my wife and I have been apart of.

Bistro 51 has a great Ahi Tuna Tartar and a lovely afternoon tea. The price to stay here can be VERY high but is expected due to the room size and location. Although this Taj property isnt as nice a some of those located in South Africa and India, it is still a very nice property and will not disappoint.

I cannot say enough how much my wife and I enjoyed our stay at Taj 51. We were in London for four days celebrating our 15th anniversary and we had not been on a trip since our kids were born over 8 years ago. Without stating the obvious, this was a very special trip for us. You have probably read about the service at the Taj and because we read these with a bit of caution we were slightly skeptical that it would live up to our expectations. Well our expectations were not met, but exceeded with flying colors. We packed about seven days of activities into four and all of this was made so much easier by service unlike any my wife and I have ever enjoyed. From several weeks before our trip to our actual stay in London, the staff was on top of everything. I felt like a pest before our trip by emailing every random question and request and they responded with timely well thoughtout answers that made our trip planning especially effortless. We have been places where the concierge will tell you how do things or help point you in the right direction, but the concierges at the Taj would handle everything from event tickets to train tickets and even dinner reservations. They even knew our names from the moment we stepped in until we left no matter who was on duty. The accommodations were fantastic and they have a really nice canape and drink event nightly and the hotel location is fantastic. Staying at Taj 51 was truly one of the best experiences my wife and I have been apart of.

this hotel never fails to suprise me on each and every visit. the suites are beautiful the staff are charming, helpful and in abundence. we had a fantastic stay. thank you all again we will be returning very soon. if your looking for a flagship hotel in london ypu wont be disapointed.

My wife and I stayed at this hotel to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. We stayed in one of the Minister suites which was simply fantastic. The rooms were equipped with everything that we needed for a 3 day stay. The location was great and the breakfasts were lovely. The staff are so attentive and are a credit to the hotel. We were made to feel extra special and it really added to the weekend. We will definitely stay at this hotel again. I would go as far to say that this hotel is the best in London - Mr Thorpe

The service and the rooms were superb, is our first visit in London and they make this moment unforgetable..! Is close to the sub station, you have all the main attractions from London just by walking, they have a wonderful cafe cross the street, for a good breakfast before the tourist walk.

Thank you for reviewing your recent stay at Taj 51 Buckingham Gate. I was delighted to read you enjoyed your suite and our famous Taj Service. I was pleased to read that your first trip to London and my team created a nice memory for you. We are within walking distant to many attractions around London includling Buckingham Palace, House of Commons, Ben Big and many more and with St. James Park Tube Station only 2 minutes walk away. I hope that your next visit to London we will be able to welcoming you back to Taj London. Best Regards Araceli Ruis-Perez Hotel Manager

We have stayed here often and from our understanding the hotel was taken back by the Taj group following management by another hotel chain. The hotel is synonymous with the Taj chain, which is our favourite chain of hotel and renowned for its superb service. Same for this hotel, service was excellent and surprisingly personal for a hotel of this size. Nothing was too much trouble. We were in a junior suite so there was plenty of room with TVs in both rooms. Beautiful courtyard with a fountain. Luckily the weather was great and we were able to enjoy lunches out there. Wifi excellent â free and fast. Perfect location and walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Big Ben, Green Park, St James Park, Victoria, Piccadilly and many other top spots. The tube station is just around the corner. Highly recommended

We stayed here with two of our close friends and stayed in the minister suites ... They were apartments!! So amazing and nothing was too much trouble.. The drinks in the court yard were great and a lovely touch with canapÃ©s Everything was so comfy and welcoming... TV in the bath!! Wow!! We went for breakfast in the morning and was the best I've tasted! Also the extras of smoked salmon, avocado and much more! Really was the best hotel we have stayed in!! Thank you to the staff that made us feel so welcome

Thank you for taking the time to write about your recent stay at Taj 51 Buckingham Gate. I am delighted you enjoyed your suite in Minsters and the facilities within the suite. Our Complimentry Drinks and Canapes are very popular with our guest and pleased you were able to join us. We do hope that we will have the pleasure of welcoming back again soon. Kind Regards Araceli Ruis-Perez Hotel Manager

We have just returned from a perfect weekend trip for our Anniversary. We arrived on Friday and were very impressed with the location and the "look" of the hotel, especially the beautiful courtyard. It is a five minute walk from the tube and is in such a great place for all the best sight-seeing in London. The area was quiet and felt very safe. From the first moments, the staff at 51 Buckingham Gate made us feel like we had arrived somewhere very special indeed. Their attentiveness and courtesy are what we will remember most about our stay. We were upgraded to a 2 bedroom apartment (falconers) on the seventh floor, with stunning views. It had everything we needed and Sergio, the concierge, showed us everything in the room and gave us lots of info about amenities in the local area. We only ate breakfast at the hotel, which was excellent both days. A fantastic selection and again the service was first class, especially Errol and Georgio. The complimentary canapÃ©s and drinks in the library each evening were a really nice treat and we spent a lovely evening in the company of the two waiters from Hungary and Spain, who were so attentive and great to chat to. We can't wait to return to the hotel - we were treated royally by everyone we met and were made to feel truly "at home". Thank you to all at 51 Buckingham Gate for making our Anniversary so very special. Room Tip: The views from the seventh floor were fantastic. See more room tips

Stayed at this hotel for the 4th time This time we were in a two bedroom apartment in Falconers Building Usual excellent service from staff. Special thanks to Erol and Eva in breakfast room for all their care and attention to us and granddaughters. Also thank you to the conceirge team.Our 2 bathroom suite had a walk in shower and a tub shower . one suggestion-- tub/showers need hand rail for getting in and out of tub. otherwise perfect hotel for stay in London.We will definitely stay at this hotel again Room Tip: We Liked the Kings building .Has private entrance We stayed there on our previous visit See more room tips

Fantastic stay at this hotel, great location, great service. Was upgraded on arrival and everything was perfect. The staff assisted us with restaurants, attractions, travel tickets, we would definitely stay here again.

I am a huge fan of the Taj hotels having stayed at many around the world. Taj 51 is next door to the Taj St James Court. (Do NOT stay there.....very noisy and awful service). Taj 51 is a gorgeous property with lovely large suites. Our room was a King Suite and had a large bedroom, separate large living room, small modern kitchen, and a reasonable bathroom. (I would have given this hotel 5 stars if the bathroom had been as impressive as the rest of the room, but the bathroom was quite small). The service is fantastic and they were always offering help with transportation, reservations, anything you need. Wifi is free. There is no parking. They offer a full continental and made to order breakfast. My only complaint is that the continental breakfast, although offered a lot of options and was delicious, really wasnt work 20 GBP. It should have been included in the (extremely high) price. The location is PERFECT. It is a 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace; 7 minutes to Clarence house/St James Palace; 15 minute walk to Big Ben/Houses of Parliament/Westminster Abbey; 7 minute drive to Harrods (probably about 25 minute walk); 10 minute walk to Trafalgar Square.......everything is very close. Try the attached, Michelin starred Quinlon restaurant. It is amazing south west Indian food. it is unlike anything you have tried.The flavors are unique with loads of both meat and vegetarian options. Bistro 51 has a great Ahi Tuna Tartar and a lovely afternoon tea. The price to stay here can be VERY high but is expected due to the room size and location.

Fantastic stay at this hotel, great location, great service. Was upgraded on arrival and everything was perfect. The staff assisted us with restaurants, attractions, travel tickets, we would definitely stay here again.

I am a huge fan of the Taj hotels having stayed at many around the world. Taj 51 is next door to the Taj St James Court. (Do NOT stay there.....very noisy and awful service). Taj 51 is a gorgeous property with lovely large suites. Our room was a King Suite and had a large bedroom, separate large living room, small modern kitchen, and a reasonable bathroom. (I would have given this hotel 5 stars if the bathroom had been as impressive as the rest of the room, but the bathroom was quite small). The service is fantastic and they were always offering help with transportation, reservations, anything you need. Wifi is free. There is no parking. They offer a full continental and made to order breakfast. My only complaint is that the continental breakfast, although offered a lot of options and was delicious, really wasnt work 20 GBP. It should have been included in the (extremely high) price. The location is PERFECT. It is a 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace; 7 minutes to Clarence house/St James Palace; 15 minute walk to Big Ben/Houses of Parliament/Westminster Abbey; 7 minute drive to Harrods (probably about 25 minute walk); 10 minute walk to Trafalgar Square.......everything is very close. Try the attached, Michelin starred Quinlon restaurant. It is amazing south west Indian food. it is unlike anything you have tried.The flavors are unique with loads of both meat and vegetarian options. Bistro 51 has a great Ahi Tuna Tartar and a lovely afternoon tea. The price to stay here can be VERY high but is expected due to the room size and location. Although this Taj property isnt as nice a some of those located in South Africa and India, it is still a very nice property and will not disappoint. Room Tip: Request a room on a higher level to avoid any noise concerns. See more room tips

I cannot say enough how much my wife and I enjoyed our stay at Taj 51. We were in London for four days celebrating our 15th anniversary and we had not been on a trip since our kids were born over 8 years ago. Without stating the obvious, this was a very special trip for us. You have probably read about the service at the Taj and because we read these with a bit of caution we were slightly skeptical that it would live up to our expectations. Well our expectations were not met, but exceeded with flying colors. We packed about seven days of activities into four and all of this was made so much easier by service unlike any my wife and I have ever enjoyed. From several weeks before our trip to our actual stay in London, the staff was on top of everything. I felt like a pest before our trip by emailing every random question and request and they responded with timely well thoughtout answers that made our trip planning especially effortless. We have been places where the concierge will tell you how do things or help point you in the right direction, but the concierges at the Taj would handle everything from event tickets to train tickets and even dinner reservations. They even knew our names from the moment we stepped in until we left no matter who was on duty. The accommodations were fantastic and they have a really nice canape and drink event nightly and the hotel location is fantastic. Staying at Taj 51 was truly one of the best experiences my wife and I have been apart of.

this hotel never fails to suprise me on each and every visit. the suites are beautiful the staff are charming, helpful and in abundence. we had a fantastic stay. thank you all again we will be returning very soon. if your looking for a flagship hotel in london ypu wont be disapointed.

My wife and I stayed at this hotel to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. We stayed in one of the Minister suites which was simply fantastic. The rooms were equipped with everything that we needed for a 3 day stay. The location was great and the breakfasts were lovely. The staff are so attentive and are a credit to the hotel. We were made to feel extra special and it really added to the weekend. We will definitely stay at this hotel again. I would go as far to say that this hotel is the best in London - Mr Thorpe

Dear Mr Thrope. First may I congratulate you both on your 10th Wedding Anniversary. Thank you for sharing your recent stay with us with other Tripadvisors.

The service and the rooms were superb, is our first visit in London and they make this moment unforgetable..! Is close to the sub station, you have all the main attractions from London just by walking, they have a wonderful cafe cross the street, for a good breakfast before the tourist walk.

Thank you for reviewing your recent stay at Taj 51 Buckingham Gate. I was delighted to read you enjoyed your suite and our famous Taj Service. I was pleased to read that your first trip to London and my team created a nice memory for you. We are within walking distant to many attractions around London includling Buckingham Palace, House of Commons, Ben Big and many more and with St. James Park Tube Station only 2 minutes walk away. I hope that your next visit to London we will be able to welcoming you back to Taj London. Best Regards Araceli Ruis-Perez Hotel Manager

We have stayed here often and from our understanding the hotel was taken back by the Taj group following management by another hotel chain. The hotel is synonymous with the Taj chain, which is our favourite chain of hotel and renowned for its superb service. Same for this hotel, service was excellent and surprisingly personal for a hotel of this size. Nothing was too much trouble. We were in a junior suite so there was plenty of room with TVs in both rooms. Beautiful courtyard with a fountain. Luckily the weather was great and we were able to enjoy lunches out there. Wifi excellent â free and fast. Perfect location and walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Big Ben, Green Park, St James Park, Victoria, Piccadilly and many other top spots. The tube station is just around the corner. Highly recommended

We stayed here with two of our close friends and stayed in the minister suites ... They were apartments!! So amazing and nothing was too much trouble.. The drinks in the court yard were great and a lovely touch with canapÃ©s Everything was so comfy and welcoming... TV in the bath!! Wow!! We went for breakfast in the morning and was the best I've tasted! Also the extras of smoked salmon, avocado and much more! Really was the best hotel we have stayed in!! Thank you to the staff that made us feel so welcome

Thank you for taking the time to write about your recent stay at Taj 51 Buckingham Gate. I am delighted you enjoyed your suite in Minsters and the facilities within the suite. Our Complimentry Drinks and Canapes are very popular with our guest and pleased you were able to join us. We do hope that we will have the pleasure of welcoming back again soon. Kind Regards Araceli Ruis-Perez Hotel Manager

We have just returned from a perfect weekend trip for our Anniversary. We arrived on Friday and were very impressed with the location and the "look" of the hotel, especially the beautiful courtyard. It is a five minute walk from the tube and is in such a great place for all the best sight-seeing in London. The area was quiet and felt very safe. From the first moments, the staff at 51 Buckingham Gate made us feel like we had arrived somewhere very special indeed. Their attentiveness and courtesy are what we will remember most about our stay. We were upgraded to a 2 bedroom apartment (falconers) on the seventh floor, with stunning views. It had everything we needed and Sergio, the concierge, showed us everything in the room and gave us lots of info about amenities in the local area. We only ate breakfast at the hotel, which was excellent both days. A fantastic selection and again the service was first class, especially Errol and Georgio. The complimentary canapÃ©s and drinks in the library each evening were a really nice treat and we spent a lovely evening in the company of the two waiters from Hungary and Spain, who were so attentive and great to chat to. We can't wait to return to the hotel - we were treated royally by everyone we met and were made to feel truly "at home". Thank you to all at 51 Buckingham Gate for making our Anniversary so very special. Room Tip: The views from the seventh floor were fantastic. See more room tips

We have just returned from a perfect weekend trip for our Anniversary. We arrived on Friday and were very impressed with the location and the "look" of the hotel, especially the beautiful courtyard. It is a five minute walk from the tube and is in such a great place for all the best sight-seeing in London. The area was quiet and felt very safe. From the first moments, the staff at 51 Buckingham Gate made us feel like we had arrived somewhere very special indeed. Their attentiveness and courtesy are what we will remember most about our stay. We were upgraded to a 2 bedroom apartment (falconers) on the seventh floor, with stunning views. It had everything we needed and Sergio, the concierge, showed us everything in the room and gave us lots of info about amenities in the local area. We only ate breakfast at the hotel, which was excellent both days. A fantastic selection and again the service was first class, especially Errol and Georgio. The complimentary canapÃ©s and drinks in the library each evening were a really nice treat and we spent a lovely evening in the company of the two waiters from Hungary and Spain, who were so attentive and great to chat to. We can't wait to return to the hotel - we were treated royally by everyone we met and were made to feel truly "at home". Thank you to all at 51 Buckingham Gate for making our Anniversary so very special. Room Tip: The views from the seventh floor were fantastic. See more room tips

Stayed at this hotel for the 4th time This time we were in a two bedroom apartment in Falconers Building Usual excellent service from staff. Special thanks to Erol and Eva in breakfast room for all their care and attention to us and granddaughters. Also thank you to the conceirge team.Our 2 bathroom suite had a walk in shower and a tub shower . one suggestion-- tub/showers need hand rail for getting in and out of tub. otherwise perfect hotel for stay in London.We will definitely stay at this hotel again Room Tip: We Liked the Kings building .Has private entrance We stayed there on our previous visit See more room tips

Fantastic stay at this hotel, great location, great service. Was upgraded on arrival and everything was perfect. The staff assisted us with restaurants, attractions, travel tickets, we would definitely stay here again.

I am a huge fan of the Taj hotels having stayed at many around the world. Taj 51 is next door to the Taj St James Court. (Do NOT stay there.....very noisy and awful service). Taj 51 is a gorgeous property with lovely large suites. Our room was a King Suite and had a large bedroom, separate large living room, small modern kitchen, and a reasonable bathroom. (I would have given this hotel 5 stars if the bathroom had been as impressive as the rest of the room, but the bathroom was quite small). The service is fantastic and they were always offering help with transportation, reservations, anything you need. Wifi is free. There is no parking. They offer a full continental and made to order breakfast. My only complaint is that the continental breakfast, although offered a lot of options and was delicious, really wasnt work 20 GBP. It should have been included in the (extremely high) price. The location is PERFECT. It is a 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace; 7 minutes to Clarence house/St James Palace; 15 minute walk to Big Ben/Houses of Parliament/Westminster Abbey; 7 minute drive to Harrods (probably about 25 minute walk); 10 minute walk to Trafalgar Square.......everything is very close. Try the attached, Michelin starred Quinlon restaurant. It is amazing south west Indian food. it is unlike anything you have tried.The flavors are unique with loads of both meat and vegetarian options. Bistro 51 has a great Ahi Tuna Tartar and a lovely afternoon tea. The price to stay here can be VERY high but is expected due to the room size and location. Although this Taj property isnt as nice a some of those located in South Africa and India, it is still a very nice property and will not disappoint. Room Tip: Request a room on a higher level to avoid any noise concerns. See more room tips

I cannot say enough how much my wife and I enjoyed our stay at Taj 51. We were in London for four days celebrating our 15th anniversary and we had not been on a trip since our kids were born over 8 years ago. Without stating the obvious, this was a very special trip for us. You have probably read about the service at the Taj and because we read these with a bit of caution we were slightly skeptical that it would live up to our expectations. Well our expectations were not met, but exceeded with flying colors. We packed about seven days of activities into four and all of this was made so much easier by service unlike any my wife and I have ever enjoyed. From several weeks before our trip to our actual stay in London, the staff was on top of everything. I felt like a pest before our trip by emailing every random question and request and they responded with timely well thoughtout answers that made our trip planning especially effortless. We have been places where the concierge will tell you how do things or help point you in the right direction, but the concierges at the Taj would handle everything from event tickets to train tickets and even dinner reservations. They even knew our names from the moment we stepped in until we left no matter who was on duty. The accommodations were fantastic and they have a really nice canape and drink event nightly and the hotel location is fantastic. Staying at Taj 51 was truly one of the best experiences my wife and I have been apart of.

this hotel never fails to suprise me on each and every visit. the suites are beautiful the staff are charming, helpful and in abundence. we had a fantastic stay. thank you all again we will be returning very soon. if your looking for a flagship hotel in london ypu wont be disapointed.

My wife and I stayed at this hotel to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. We stayed in one of the Minister suites which was simply fantastic. The rooms were equipped with everything that we needed for a 3 day stay. The location was great and the breakfasts were lovely. The staff are so attentive and are a credit to the hotel. We were made to feel extra special and it really added to the weekend. We will definitely stay at this hotel again. I would go as far to say that this hotel is the best in London - Mr Thorpe

Dear Mr Thrope. First may I congratulate you both on your 10th Wedding Anniversary. Thank you for sharing your recent stay with us with other Tripadvisors.

The service and the rooms were superb, is our first visit in London and they make this moment unforgetable..! Is close to the sub station, you have all the main attractions from London just by walking, they have a wonderful cafe cross the street, for a good breakfast before the tourist walk.

Thank you for reviewing your recent stay at Taj 51 Buckingham Gate. I was delighted to read you enjoyed your suite and our famous Taj Service. I was pleased to read that your first trip to London and my team created a nice memory for you. We are within walking distant to many attractions around London includling Buckingham Palace, House of Commons, Ben Big and many more and with St. James Park Tube Station only 2 minutes walk away. I hope that your next visit to London we will be able to welcoming you back to Taj London. Best Regards Araceli Ruis-Perez Hotel Manager

We have stayed here often and from our understanding the hotel was taken back by the Taj group following management by another hotel chain. The hotel is synonymous with the Taj chain, which is our favourite chain of hotel and renowned for its superb service. Same for this hotel, service was excellent and surprisingly personal for a hotel of this size. Nothing was too much trouble. We were in a junior suite so there was plenty of room with TVs in both rooms. Beautiful courtyard with a fountain. Luckily the weather was great and we were able to enjoy lunches out there. Wifi excellent â free and fast. Perfect location and walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Big Ben, Green Park, St James Park, Victoria, Piccadilly and many other top spots. The tube station is just around the corner. Highly recommended

We stayed here with two of our close friends and stayed in the minister suites ... They were apartments!! So amazing and nothing was too much trouble.. The drinks in the court yard were great and a lovely touch with canapÃ©s Everything was so comfy and welcoming... TV in the bath!! Wow!! We went for breakfast in the morning and was the best I've tasted! Also the extras of smoked salmon, avocado and much more! Really was the best hotel we have stayed in!! Thank you to the staff that made us feel so welcome

We have stayed here often and from our understanding the hotel was taken back by the Taj group following management by another hotel chain. The hotel is synonymous with the Taj chain, which is our favourite chain of hotel and renowned for its superb service. Same for this hotel, service was excellent and surprisingly personal for a hotel of this size. Nothing was too much trouble. We were in a junior suite so there was plenty of room with TVs in both rooms. Beautiful courtyard with a fountain. Luckily the weather was great and we were able to enjoy lunches out there. Wifi excellent â free and fast. Perfect location and walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Big Ben, Green Park, St James Park, Victoria, Piccadilly and many other top spots. The tube station is just around the corner. Highly recommended

We stayed here with two of our close friends and stayed in the minister suites ... They were apartments!! So amazing and nothing was too much trouble.. The drinks in the court yard were great and a lovely touch with canapÃ©s Everything was so comfy and welcoming... TV in the bath!! Wow!! We went for breakfast in the morning and was the best I've tasted! Also the extras of smoked salmon, avocado and much more! Really was the best hotel we have stayed in!! Thank you to the staff that made us feel so welcome

Thank you for taking the time to write about your recent stay at Taj 51 Buckingham Gate. I am delighted you enjoyed your suite in Minsters and the facilities within the suite. Our Complimentry Drinks and Canapes are very popular with our guest and pleased you were able to join us. We do hope that we will have the pleasure of welcoming back again soon.

We have just returned from a perfect weekend trip for our Anniversary. We arrived on Friday and were very impressed with the location and the "look" of the hotel, especially the beautiful courtyard. It is a five minute walk from the tube and is in such a great place for all the best sight-seeing in London. The area was quiet and felt very safe. From the first moments, the staff at 51 Buckingham Gate made us feel like we had arrived somewhere very special indeed. Their attentiveness and courtesy are what we will remember most about our stay. We were upgraded to a 2 bedroom apartment (falconers) on the seventh floor, with stunning views. It had everything we needed and Sergio, the concierge, showed us everything in the room and gave us lots of info about amenities in the local area. We only ate breakfast at the hotel, which was excellent both days. A fantastic selection and again the service was first class, especially Errol and Georgio. The complimentary canapÃ©s and drinks in the library each evening were a really nice treat and we spent a lovely evening in the company of the two waiters from Hungary and Spain, who were so attentive and great to chat to. We can't wait to return to the hotel - we were treated royally by everyone we met and were made to feel truly "at home". Thank you to all at 51 Buckingham Gate for making our Anniversary so very special. Room Tip: The views from the seventh floor were fantastic. See more room tips

Stayed at this hotel for the 4th time This time we were in a two bedroom apartment in Falconers Building Usual excellent service from staff. Special thanks to Erol and Eva in breakfast room for all their care and attention to us and granddaughters. Also thank you to the conceirge team.Our 2 bathroom suite had a walk in shower and a tub shower . one suggestion-- tub/showers need hand rail for getting in and out of tub. otherwise perfect hotel for stay in London.We will definitely stay at this hotel again Room Tip: We Liked the Kings building .Has private entrance We stayed there on our previous visit See more room tips

Fantastic stay at this hotel, great location, great service. Was upgraded on arrival and everything was perfect. The staff assisted us with restaurants, attractions, travel tickets, we would definitely stay here again.

I am a huge fan of the Taj hotels having stayed at many around the world. Taj 51 is next door to the Taj St James Court. (Do NOT stay there.....very noisy and awful service). Taj 51 is a gorgeous property with lovely large suites. Our room was a King Suite and had a large bedroom, separate large living room, small modern kitchen, and a reasonable bathroom. (I would have given this hotel 5 stars if the bathroom had been as impressive as the rest of the room, but the bathroom was quite small). The service is fantastic and they were always offering help with transportation, reservations, anything you need. Wifi is free. There is no parking. They offer a full continental and made to order breakfast. My only complaint is that the continental breakfast, although offered a lot of options and was delicious, really wasnt work 20 GBP. It should have been included in the (extremely high) price. The location is PERFECT. It is a 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace; 7 minutes to Clarence house/St James Palace; 15 minute walk to Big Ben/Houses of Parliament/Westminster Abbey; 7 minute drive to Harrods (probably about 25 minute walk); 10 minute walk to Trafalgar Square.......everything is very close. Try the attached, Michelin starred Quinlon restaurant. It is amazing south west Indian food. it is unlike anything you have tried.The flavors are unique with loads of both meat and vegetarian options. Bistro 51 has a great Ahi Tuna Tartar and a lovely afternoon tea. The price to stay here can be VERY high but is expected due to the room size and location. Although this Taj property isnt as nice a some of those located in South Africa and India, it is still a very nice property and will not disappoint. Room Tip: Request a room on a higher level to avoid any noise concerns. See more room tips

I cannot say enough how much my wife and I enjoyed our stay at Taj 51. We were in London for four days celebrating our 15th anniversary and we had not been on a trip since our kids were born over 8 years ago. Without stating the obvious, this was a very special trip for us. You have probably read about the service at the Taj and because we read these with a bit of caution we were slightly skeptical that it would live up to our expectations. Well our expectations were not met, but exceeded with flying colors. We packed about seven days of activities into four and all of this was made so much easier by service unlike any my wife and I have ever enjoyed. From several weeks before our trip to our actual stay in London, the staff was on top of everything. I felt like a pest before our trip by emailing every random question and request and they responded with timely well thoughtout answers that made our trip planning especially effortless. We have been places where the concierge will tell you how do things or help point you in the right direction, but the concierges at the Taj would handle everything from event tickets to train tickets and even dinner reservations. They even knew our names from the moment we stepped in until we left no matter who was on duty. The accommodations were fantastic and they have a really nice canape and drink event nightly and the hotel location is fantastic. Staying at Taj 51 was truly one of the best experiences my wife and I have been apart of.

this hotel never fails to suprise me on each and every visit. the suites are beautiful the staff are charming, helpful and in abundence. we had a fantastic stay. thank you all again we will be returning very soon. if your looking for a flagship hotel in london ypu wont be disapointed.

My wife and I stayed at this hotel to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. We stayed in one of the Minister suites which was simply fantastic. The rooms were equipped with everything that we needed for a 3 day stay. The location was great and the breakfasts were lovely. The staff are so attentive and are a credit to the hotel. We were made to feel extra special and it really added to the weekend. We will definitely stay at this hotel again. I would go as far to say that this hotel is the best in London - Mr Thorpe

My wife and I stayed at this hotel to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. We stayed in one of the Minister suites which was simply fantastic. The rooms were equipped with everything that we needed for a 3 day stay. The location was great and the breakfasts were lovely. The staff are so attentive and are a credit to the hotel. We were made to feel extra special and it really added to the weekend. We will definitely stay at this hotel again. I would go as far to say that this hotel is the best in London - Mr Thorpe

The service and the rooms were superb, is our first visit in London and they make this moment unforgetable..! Is close to the sub station, you have all the main attractions from London just by walking, they have a wonderful cafe cross the street, for a good breakfast before the tourist walk.

Thank you for reviewing your recent stay at Taj 51 Buckingham Gate. I was delighted to read you enjoyed your suite and our famous Taj Service. I was pleased to read that your first trip to London and my team created a nice memory for you. We are within walking distant to many attractions around London includling Buckingham Palace, House of Commons, Ben Big and many more and with St. James Park Tube Station only 2 minutes walk away. I hope that your next visit to London we will be able to welcoming you back to Taj London. Best Regards Araceli Ruis-Perez Hotel Manager

We have stayed here often and from our understanding the hotel was taken back by the Taj group following management by another hotel chain. The hotel is synonymous with the Taj chain, which is our favourite chain of hotel and renowned for its superb service. Same for this hotel, service was excellent and surprisingly personal for a hotel of this size. Nothing was too much trouble. We were in a junior suite so there was plenty of room with TVs in both rooms. Beautiful courtyard with a fountain. Luckily the weather was great and we were able to enjoy lunches out there. Wifi excellent â free and fast. Perfect location and walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Big Ben, Green Park, St James Park, Victoria, Piccadilly and many other top spots. The tube station is just around the corner. Highly recommended

We stayed here with two of our close friends and stayed in the minister suites ... They were apartments!! So amazing and nothing was too much trouble.. The drinks in the court yard were great and a lovely touch with canapÃ©s Everything was so comfy and welcoming... TV in the bath!! Wow!! We went for breakfast in the morning and was the best I've tasted! Also the extras of smoked salmon, avocado and much more! Really was the best hotel we have stayed in!! Thank you to the staff that made us feel so welcome

Thank you for taking the time to write about your recent stay at Taj 51 Buckingham Gate. I am delighted you enjoyed your suite in Minsters and the facilities within the suite. Our Complimentry Drinks and Canapes are very popular with our guest and pleased you were able to join us. We do hope that we will have the pleasure of welcoming back again soon. Kind Regards Araceli Ruis-Perez Hotel Manager

We have just returned from a perfect weekend trip for our Anniversary. We arrived on Friday and were very impressed with the location and the "look" of the hotel, especially the beautiful courtyard. It is a five minute walk from the tube and is in such a great place for all the best sight-seeing in London. The area was quiet and felt very safe. From the first moments, the staff at 51 Buckingham Gate made us feel like we had arrived somewhere very special indeed. Their attentiveness and courtesy are what we will remember most about our stay. We were upgraded to a 2 bedroom apartment (falconers) on the seventh floor, with stunning views. It had everything we needed and Sergio, the concierge, showed us everything in the room and gave us lots of info about amenities in the local area. We only ate breakfast at the hotel, which was excellent both days. A fantastic selection and again the service was first class, especially Errol and Georgio. The complimentary canapÃ©s and drinks in the library each evening were a really nice treat and we spent a lovely evening in the company of the two waiters from Hungary and Spain, who were so attentive and great to chat to. We can't wait to return to the hotel - we were treated royally by everyone we met and were made to feel truly "at home". Thank you to all at 51 Buckingham Gate for making our Anniversary so very special. Room Tip: The views from the seventh floor were fantastic. See more room tips

Stayed at this hotel for the 4th time This time we were in a two bedroom apartment in Falconers Building Usual excellent service from staff. Special thanks to Erol and Eva in breakfast room for all their care and attention to us and granddaughters. Also thank you to the conceirge team.Our 2 bathroom suite had a walk in shower and a tub shower . one suggestion-- tub/showers need hand rail for getting in and out of tub. otherwise perfect hotel for stay in London.We will definitely stay at this hotel again Room Tip: We Liked the Kings building .Has private entrance We stayed there on our previous visit See more room tips

Fantastic stay at this hotel, great location, great service. Was upgraded on arrival and everything was perfect. The staff assisted us with restaurants, attractions, travel tickets, we would definitely stay here again.

I am a huge fan of the Taj hotels having stayed at many around the world. Taj 51 is next door to the Taj St James Court. (Do NOT stay there.....very noisy and awful service). Taj 51 is a gorgeous property with lovely large suites. Our room was a King Suite and had a large bedroom, separate large living room, small modern kitchen, and a reasonable bathroom. (I would have given this hotel 5 stars if the bathroom had been as impressive as the rest of the room, but the bathroom was quite small). The service is fantastic and they were always offering help with transportation, reservations, anything you need. Wifi is free. There is no parking. They offer a full continental and made to order breakfast. My only complaint is that the continental breakfast, although offered a lot of options and was delicious, really wasnt work 20 GBP. It should have been included in the (extremely high) price. The location is PERFECT. It is a 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace; 7 minutes to Clarence house/St James Palace; 15 minute walk to Big Ben/Houses of Parliament/Westminster Abbey; 7 minute drive to Harrods (probably about 25 minute walk); 10 minute walk to Trafalgar Square.......everything is very close. Try the attached, Michelin starred Quinlon restaurant. It is amazing south west Indian food. it is unlike anything you have tried.The flavors are unique with loads of both meat and vegetarian options. Bistro 51 has a great Ahi Tuna Tartar and a lovely afternoon tea. The price to stay here can be VERY high but is expected due to the room size and location. Although this Taj property isnt as nice a some of those located in South Africa and India, it is still a very nice property and will not disappoint. Room Tip: Request a room on a higher level to avoid any noise concerns. See more room tips

I cannot say enough how much my wife and I enjoyed our stay at Taj 51. We were in London for four days celebrating our 15th anniversary and we had not been on a trip since our kids were born over 8 years ago. Without stating the obvious, this was a very special trip for us. You have probably read about the service at the Taj and because we read these with a bit of caution we were slightly skeptical that it would live up to our expectations. Well our expectations were not met, but exceeded with flying colors. We packed about seven days of activities into four and all of this was made so much easier by service unlike any my wife and I have ever enjoyed. From several weeks before our trip to our actual stay in London, the staff was on top of everything. I felt like a pest before our trip by emailing every random question and request and they responded with timely well thoughtout answers that made our trip planning especially effortless. We have been places where the concierge will tell you how do things or help point you in the right direction, but the concierges at the Taj would handle everything from event tickets to train tickets and even dinner reservations. They even knew our names from the moment we stepped in until we left no matter who was on duty. The accommodations were fantastic and they have a really nice canape and drink event nightly and the hotel location is fantastic. Staying at Taj 51 was truly one of the best experiences my wife and I have been apart of.

Bistro 51 has a great Ahi Tuna Tartar and a lovely afternoon tea. The price to stay here can be VERY high but is expected due to the room size and location. Although this Taj property isnt as nice a some of those located in South Africa and India, it is still a very nice property and will not disappoint.

I cannot say enough how much my wife and I enjoyed our stay at Taj 51. We were in London for four days celebrating our 15th anniversary and we had not been on a trip since our kids were born over 8 years ago. Without stating the obvious, this was a very special trip for us. You have probably read about the service at the Taj and because we read these with a bit of caution we were slightly skeptical that it would live up to our expectations. Well our expectations were not met, but exceeded with flying colors. We packed about seven days of activities into four and all of this was made so much easier by service unlike any my wife and I have ever enjoyed. From several weeks before our trip to our actual stay in London, the staff was on top of everything. I felt like a pest before our trip by emailing every random question and request and they responded with timely well thoughtout answers that made our trip planning especially effortless. We have been places where the concierge will tell you how do things or help point you in the right direction, but the concierges at the Taj would handle everything from event tickets to train tickets and even dinner reservations. They even knew our names from the moment we stepped in until we left no matter who was on duty. The accommodations were fantastic and they have a really nice canape and drink event nightly and the hotel location is fantastic. Staying at Taj 51 was truly one of the best experiences my wife and I have been apart of.

this hotel never fails to suprise me on each and every visit. the suites are beautiful the staff are charming, helpful and in abundence. we had a fantastic stay. thank you all again we will be returning very soon. if your looking for a flagship hotel in london ypu wont be disapointed.

My wife and I stayed at this hotel to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. We stayed in one of the Minister suites which was simply fantastic. The rooms were equipped with everything that we needed for a 3 day stay. The location was great and the breakfasts were lovely. The staff are so attentive and are a credit to the hotel. We were made to feel extra special and it really added to the weekend. We will definitely stay at this hotel again. I would go as far to say that this hotel is the best in London - Mr Thorpe

The service and the rooms were superb, is our first visit in London and they make this moment unforgetable..! Is close to the sub station, you have all the main attractions from London just by walking, they have a wonderful cafe cross the street, for a good breakfast before the tourist walk.

Thank you for reviewing your recent stay at Taj 51 Buckingham Gate. I was delighted to read you enjoyed your suite and our famous Taj Service. I was pleased to read that your first trip to London and my team created a nice memory for you. We are within walking distant to many attractions around London includling Buckingham Palace, House of Commons, Ben Big and many more and with St. James Park Tube Station only 2 minutes walk away. I hope that your next visit to London we will be able to welcoming you back to Taj London. Best Regards Araceli Ruis-Perez Hotel Manager

We have stayed here often and from our understanding the hotel was taken back by the Taj group following management by another hotel chain. The hotel is synonymous with the Taj chain, which is our favourite chain of hotel and renowned for its superb service. Same for this hotel, service was excellent and surprisingly personal for a hotel of this size. Nothing was too much trouble. We were in a junior suite so there was plenty of room with TVs in both rooms. Beautiful courtyard with a fountain. Luckily the weather was great and we were able to enjoy lunches out there. Wifi excellent â free and fast. Perfect location and walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Big Ben, Green Park, St James Park, Victoria, Piccadilly and many other top spots. The tube station is just around the corner. Highly recommended

We stayed here with two of our close friends and stayed in the minister suites ... They were apartments!! So amazing and nothing was too much trouble.. The drinks in the court yard were great and a lovely touch with canapÃ©s Everything was so comfy and welcoming... TV in the bath!! Wow!! We went for breakfast in the morning and was the best I've tasted! Also the extras of smoked salmon, avocado and much more! Really was the best hotel we have stayed in!! Thank you to the staff that made us feel so welcome

Thank you for taking the time to write about your recent stay at Taj 51 Buckingham Gate. I am delighted you enjoyed your suite in Minsters and the facilities within the suite. Our Complimentry Drinks and Canapes are very popular with our guest and pleased you were able to join us. We do hope that we will have the pleasure of welcoming back again soon. Kind Regards Araceli Ruis-Perez Hotel Manager

We have just returned from a perfect weekend trip for our Anniversary. We arrived on Friday and were very impressed with the location and the "look" of the hotel, especially the beautiful courtyard. It is a five minute walk from the tube and is in such a great place for all the best sight-seeing in London. The area was quiet and felt very safe. From the first moments, the staff at 51 Buckingham Gate made us feel like we had arrived somewhere very special indeed. Their attentiveness and courtesy are what we will remember most about our stay. We were upgraded to a 2 bedroom apartment (falconers) on the seventh floor, with stunning views. It had everything we needed and Sergio, the concierge, showed us everything in the room and gave us lots of info about amenities in the local area. We only ate breakfast at the hotel, which was excellent both days. A fantastic selection and again the service was first class, especially Errol and Georgio. The complimentary canapÃ©s and drinks in the library each evening were a really nice treat and we spent a lovely evening in the company of the two waiters from Hungary and Spain, who were so attentive and great to chat to. We can't wait to return to the hotel - we were treated royally by everyone we met and were made to feel truly "at home". Thank you to all at 51 Buckingham Gate for making our Anniversary so very special. Room Tip: The views from the seventh floor were fantastic. See more room tips

Stayed at this hotel for the 4th time This time we were in a two bedroom apartment in Falconers Building Usual excellent service from staff. Special thanks to Erol and Eva in breakfast room for all their care and attention to us and granddaughters. Also thank you to the conceirge team.Our 2 bathroom suite had a walk in shower and a tub shower . one suggestion-- tub/showers need hand rail for getting in and out of tub. otherwise perfect hotel for stay in London.We will definitely stay at this hotel again Room Tip: We Liked the Kings building .Has private entrance We stayed there on our previous visit See more room tips

Fantastic stay at this hotel, great location, great service. Was upgraded on arrival and everything was perfect. The staff assisted us with restaurants, attractions, travel tickets, we would definitely stay here again.

I am a huge fan of the Taj hotels having stayed at many around the world. Taj 51 is next door to the Taj St James Court. (Do NOT stay there.....very noisy and awful service). Taj 51 is a gorgeous property with lovely large suites. Our room was a King Suite and had a large bedroom, separate large living room, small modern kitchen, and a reasonable bathroom. (I would have given this hotel 5 stars if the bathroom had been as impressive as the rest of the room, but the bathroom was quite small). The service is fantastic and they were always offering help with transportation, reservations, anything you need. Wifi is free. There is no parking. They offer a full continental and made to order breakfast. My only complaint is that the continental breakfast, although offered a lot of options and was delicious, really wasnt work 20 GBP. It should have been included in the (extremely high) price. The location is PERFECT. It is a 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace; 7 minutes to Clarence house/St James Palace; 15 minute walk to Big Ben/Houses of Parliament/Westminster Abbey; 7 minute drive to Harrods (probably about 25 minute walk); 10 minute walk to Trafalgar Square.......everything is very close. Try the attached, Michelin starred Quinlon restaurant. It is amazing south west Indian food. it is unlike anything you have tried.The flavors are unique with loads of both meat and vegetarian options. Bistro 51 has a great Ahi Tuna Tartar and a lovely afternoon tea. The price to stay here can be VERY high but is expected due to the room size and location.

Fantastic stay at this hotel, great location, great service. Was upgraded on arrival and everything was perfect. The staff assisted us with restaurants, attractions, travel tickets, we would definitely stay here again.

I am a huge fan of the Taj hotels having stayed at many around the world. Taj 51 is next door to the Taj St James Court. (Do NOT stay there.....very noisy and awful service). Taj 51 is a gorgeous property with lovely large suites. Our room was a King Suite and had a large bedroom, separate large living room, small modern kitchen, and a reasonable bathroom. (I would have given this hotel 5 stars if the bathroom had been as impressive as the rest of the room, but the bathroom was quite small). The service is fantastic and they were always offering help with transportation, reservations, anything you need. Wifi is free. There is no parking. They offer a full continental and made to order breakfast. My only complaint is that the continental breakfast, although offered a lot of options and was delicious, really wasnt work 20 GBP. It should have been included in the (extremely high) price. The location is PERFECT. It is a 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace; 7 minutes to Clarence house/St James Palace; 15 minute walk to Big Ben/Houses of Parliament/Westminster Abbey; 7 minute drive to Harrods (probably about 25 minute walk); 10 minute walk to Trafalgar Square.......everything is very close. Try the attached, Michelin starred Quinlon restaurant. It is amazing south west Indian food. it is unlike anything you have tried.The flavors are unique with loads of both meat and vegetarian options. Bistro 51 has a great Ahi Tuna Tartar and a lovely afternoon tea. The price to stay here can be VERY high but is expected due to the room size and location. Although this Taj property isnt as nice a some of those located in South Africa and India, it is still a very nice property and will not disappoint. Room Tip: Request a room on a higher level to avoid any noise concerns. See more room tips

I cannot say enough how much my wife and I enjoyed our stay at Taj 51. We were in London for four days celebrating our 15th anniversary and we had not been on a trip since our kids were born over 8 years ago. Without stating the obvious, this was a very special trip for us. You have probably read about the service at the Taj and because we read these with a bit of caution we were slightly skeptical that it would live up to our expectations. Well our expectations were not met, but exceeded with flying colors. We packed about seven days of activities into four and all of this was made so much easier by service unlike any my wife and I have ever enjoyed. From several weeks before our trip to our actual stay in London, the staff was on top of everything. I felt like a pest before our trip by emailing every random question and request and they responded with timely well thoughtout answers that made our trip planning especially effortless. We have been places where the concierge will tell you how do things or help point you in the right direction, but the concierges at the Taj would handle everything from event tickets to train tickets and even dinner reservations. They even knew our names from the moment we stepped in until we left no matter who was on duty. The accommodations were fantastic and they have a really nice canape and drink event nightly and the hotel location is fantastic. Staying at Taj 51 was truly one of the best experiences my wife and I have been apart of.

this hotel never fails to suprise me on each and every visit. the suites are beautiful the staff are charming, helpful and in abundence. we had a fantastic stay. thank you all again we will be returning very soon. if your looking for a flagship hotel in london ypu wont be disapointed.

My wife and I stayed at this hotel to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. We stayed in one of the Minister suites which was simply fantastic. The rooms were equipped with everything that we needed for a 3 day stay. The location was great and the breakfasts were lovely. The staff are so attentive and are a credit to the hotel. We were made to feel extra special and it really added to the weekend. We will definitely stay at this hotel again. I would go as far to say that this hotel is the best in London - Mr Thorpe

I hope that your next visit to London we will be able to welcoming you back to Taj London. Best Regards Araceli Ruis-Perez Hotel Manager

We have stayed here often and from our understanding the hotel was taken back by the Taj group following management by another hotel chain. The hotel is synonymous with the Taj chain, which is our favourite chain of hotel and renowned for its superb service. Same for this hotel, service was excellent and surprisingly personal for a hotel of this size. Nothing was too much trouble. We were in a junior suite so there was plenty of room with TVs in both rooms. Beautiful courtyard with a fountain. Luckily the weather was great and we were able to enjoy lunches out there. Wifi excellent â free and fast. Perfect location and walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Big Ben, Green Park, St James Park, Victoria, Piccadilly and many other top spots. The tube station is just around the corner. Highly recommended

We stayed here with two of our close friends and stayed in the minister suites ... They were apartments!! So amazing and nothing was too much trouble.. The drinks in the court yard were great and a lovely touch with canapÃ©s Everything was so comfy and welcoming... TV in the bath!! Wow!! We went for breakfast in the morning and was the best I've tasted! Also the extras of smoked salmon, avocado and much more! Really was the best hotel we have stayed in!! Thank you to the staff that made us feel so welcome

Thank you for taking the time to write about your recent stay at Taj 51 Buckingham Gate. I am delighted you enjoyed your suite in Minsters and the facilities within the suite.

We have just returned from a perfect weekend trip for our Anniversary. We arrived on Friday and were very impressed with the location and the "look" of the hotel, especially the beautiful courtyard. It is a five minute walk from the tube and is in such a great place for all the best sight-seeing in London. The area was quiet and felt very safe. From the first moments, the staff at 51 Buckingham Gate made us feel like we had arrived somewhere very special indeed. Their attentiveness and courtesy are what we will remember most about our stay. We were upgraded to a 2 bedroom apartment (falconers) on the seventh floor, with stunning views. It had everything we needed and Sergio, the concierge, showed us everything in the room and gave us lots of info about amenities in the local area. We only ate breakfast at the hotel, which was excellent both days. A fantastic selection and again the service was first class, especially Errol and Georgio. The complimentary canapÃ©s and drinks in the library each evening were a really nice treat and we spent a lovely evening in the company of the two waiters from Hungary and Spain, who were so attentive and great to chat to. We can't wait to return to the hotel - we were treated royally by everyone we met and were made to feel truly "at home". Thank you to all at 51 Buckingham Gate for making our Anniversary so very special. Room Tip: The views from the seventh floor were fantastic. See more room tips
