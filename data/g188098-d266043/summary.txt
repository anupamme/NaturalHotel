We had a loft room which felt spacious and practical with mini kitchen and dining area, sofa-tv area then our bedroom & bathroom on the mezzanine level. The bed was a true double, not 2 twin beds parked together. There's a side-on view towards the Matterhorn, so you go out onto the balcony and look right for the view. Only thing to note here is that the outside area is a bit 'shared' as we noticed a few of our neighbours wandering around outside our windows. Also minor things we noticed on arrival - we had chipped cups/saucers and there was hair /other bits on sofa which the cleaning team had missed. Yes these are minor /insignificant points, but given the price paid per night here, I expected more attention to such detail. Breakfast was fine, you can ask for eggs and bacon which they cook separately. Overall a very enjoyable stay and I would recommend, thanks Leni & Thomas.

There is a large Hamman style spa on the lower level and a heated pool on the main level. Even the entrance to the hotel is impressive through a private tunnel and elevator built into the hill. There is a great breakfast buffet with so many choices you don't where to start. You can also have a drink or coffee in the sheepskin covered couches in the lobby or outside terrace.

We enjoyed walking into the bat-cave style entrance and the welcome prosecco provided by our hosts was a nice touch. We had a loft room which felt spacious and practical with mini kitchen and dining area, sofa-tv area then our bedroom & bathroom on the mezzanine level. The bed was a true double, not 2 twin beds parked together. There's a side-on view towards the Matterhorn, so you go out onto the balcony and look right for the view. Only thing to note here is that the outside area is a bit 'shared' as we noticed a few of our neighbours wandering around outside our windows. Also minor things we noticed on arrival - we had chipped cups/saucers and there was hair /other bits on sofa which the cleaning team had missed. Yes these are minor /insignificant points, but given the price paid per night here, I expected more attention to such detail. Breakfast was fine, you can ask for eggs and bacon which they cook separately. Overall a very enjoyable stay and I would recommend, thanks Leni & Thomas.

The location is perfect just five minutes walk from the center of town but far enough away to be quiet and with wonderful views of the mountains especially the iconic Matterhorn. The exterior design is a contemporary interpretation of the classic Swiss lodge while the interior is funky and very comfortable in the public areas as was our loft room. You can just see and feel the love that has gone into this place. The staff are all wonderful also and frankly you feel like you are staying with good friends rather than at a hotel. There is a large Hamman style spa on the lower level and a heated pool on the main level. Even the entrance to the hotel is impressive through a private tunnel and elevator built into the hill. There is a great breakfast buffet with so many choices you don't where to start. You can also have a drink or coffee in the sheepskin covered couches in the lobby or outside terrace. The lobby has a glass floor which looks down onto the Hamman pool. I highly recommend this place and frankly it is one of the most enjoyable and memorable places we have ever stayed in.", "Reviewer Name": "PeterAZ", "Place": "Scottsdale", "Date": "10 September 2014", "management_response": "", "Badges": "374 reviews 75 hotel reviews Reviews in 123 cities 198 helpful votes"}, {"rating": "5 of 5 stars", "room_tip": "", "traveled_as": "Stayed September 2014", "title": "Shortcut to paradise", "review": "Everything is perfect here...and behind this perfection there is the passion of a lovely family.

We had a loft room which felt spacious and practical with mini kitchen and dining area, sofa-tv area then our bedroom & bathroom on the mezzanine level. The bed was a true double, not 2 twin beds parked together. There's a side-on view towards the Matterhorn, so you go out onto the balcony and look right for the view. Only thing to note here is that the outside area is a bit 'shared' as we noticed a few of our neighbours wandering around outside our windows. Also minor things we noticed on arrival - we had chipped cups/saucers and there was hair /other bits on sofa which the cleaning team had missed. Yes these are minor /insignificant points, but given the price paid per night here, I expected more attention to such detail. Breakfast was fine, you can ask for eggs and bacon which they cook separately. Overall a very enjoyable stay and I would recommend, thanks Leni & Thomas.

We stayed in this beautiful hotel last year when we got married in Zermatt. Now we got to return and this time with our 1 year old son. The warm welcome of Thomas and Leni made us feel right at home. They recognized us instantly from last year and loved to see our boy who they haven't met before. We had booked the small double room. The room has bottom to top windows which can open. The room was a good size for us and had everything we needed and the bed sleeps amazing. A nice light bathroom with a good shower. Everybody at the hotel makes you feel at home and this is also why you love to relax downstairs in the nice big lounging area or if the weather permitts outside. The spa is the ideal to relax after a long day of walking or skiing. We needed someone to watch our boy because of a birthday diner in the evening. With the help of Leni's daughter who is an excellent babysitter we had a great night out. Our boy could sleep in his bed at the hotel which gave us a comforting feeling. The next day we had a breakfast outside and the birthday girl was surprised by Leni with a lovely and very delicious birthday cake. Thank you again so much! See you next year!
