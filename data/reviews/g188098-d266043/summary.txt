There is a large Hamman style spa on the lower level and a heated pool on the main level. Even the entrance to the hotel is impressive through a private tunnel and elevator built into the hill. There is a great breakfast buffet with so many choices you don't where to start. You can also have a drink or coffee in the sheepskin covered couches in the lobby or outside terrace.

Also minor things we noticed on arrival - we had chipped cups/saucers and there was hair /other bits on sofa which the cleaning team had missed. Yes these are minor /insignificant points, but given the price paid per night here, I expected more attention to such detail.

We stayed in this beautiful hotel last year when we got married in Zermatt. Now we got to return and this time with our 1 year old son. The warm welcome of Thomas and Leni made us feel right at home. They recognized us instantly from last year and loved to see our boy who they haven't met before. We had booked the small double room. The room has bottom to top windows which can open. The room was a good size for us and had everything we needed and the bed sleeps amazing. A nice light bathroom with a good shower. Everybody at the hotel makes you feel at home and this is also why you love to relax downstairs in the nice big lounging area or if the weather permitts outside. The spa is the ideal to relax after a long day of walking or skiing. We needed someone to watch our boy because of a birthday diner in the evening. With the help of Leni's daughter who is an excellent babysitter we had a great night out. Our boy could sleep in his bed at the hotel which gave us a comforting feeling. The next day we had a breakfast outside and the birthday girl was surprised by Leni with a lovely and very delicious birthday cake. Thank you again so much! See you next year!

Waking-up with the view on the Matterhorn from the bed (penthouse suite) is the perfect start for a beautiful day. The SPA, with Hamman, Sauna, indoor swimming pool and outside jacuzzi with view on the Matterhorn give you many options of being pampered. Be careful, it is a difficult place to leave.", "Place": "", "ReviewerImage": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/01/2e/70/66/avatar044.jpg", "Date": "no-date", "management_response": "", "Badges": "6 reviews Reviews in 4 cities"}, {"rating": "4 of 5 stars", "room_tip": "Room Tip: Rooms in the main (/older) building have views directly facing the Matterhorn so ask for rooms here...

We enjoyed walking into the bat-cave style entrance and the welcome prosecco provided by our hosts was a nice touch. We had a loft room which felt spacious and practical with mini kitchen and dining area, sofa-tv area then our bedroom & bathroom on the mezzanine level. The bed was a true double, not 2 twin beds parked together. There's a side-on view towards the Matterhorn, so you go out onto the balcony and look right for the view. Only thing to note here is that the outside area is a bit 'shared' as we noticed a few of our neighbours wandering around outside our windows. Also minor things we noticed on arrival - we had chipped cups/saucers and there was hair /other bits on sofa which the cleaning team had missed. Yes these are minor /insignificant points, but given the price paid per night here, I expected more attention to such detail. Breakfast was fine, you can ask for eggs and bacon which they cook separately. Overall a very enjoyable stay and I would recommend, thanks Leni & Thomas.

My only addition would be to relax and enjoy this very special place.
