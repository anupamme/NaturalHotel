This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

We look forward to having you stay with us again in the future. Mahalo

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to review our property on Trip Advisor. We were sorry to hear that you were extremely disappointed with your recent stay and we are concerned that your room was not properly cleaned.

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

Loved this hotel. The location is superb, as are the facilities. The front desk staff are a credit to the hotel. They are so helpful and welcoming. Would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to others.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day.

Loved this hotel. The location is superb, as are the facilities. The front desk staff are a credit to the hotel. They are so helpful and welcoming. Would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to others.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

We were sorry to hear that you were extremely disappointed with your recent stay and we are concerned that your room was not properly cleaned.

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks!

The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

Loved this hotel. The location is superb, as are the facilities. The front desk staff are a credit to the hotel. They are so helpful and welcoming. Would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to others.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon.

Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

Loved this hotel. The location is superb, as are the facilities. The front desk staff are a credit to the hotel. They are so helpful and welcoming. Would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to others.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything.

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

Loved this hotel. The location is superb, as are the facilities. The front desk staff are a credit to the hotel. They are so helpful and welcoming. Would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to others.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

Loved this hotel. The location is superb, as are the facilities. The front desk staff are a credit to the hotel. They are so helpful and welcoming. Would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to others.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us!

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby.

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

Loved this hotel. The location is superb, as are the facilities. The front desk staff are a credit to the hotel. They are so helpful and welcoming. Would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to others.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops.

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

Loved this hotel. The location is superb, as are the facilities. The front desk staff are a credit to the hotel. They are so helpful and welcoming. Would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to others.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to review our property on Trip Advisor. We were sorry to hear that you were extremely disappointed with your recent stay and we are concerned that your room was not properly cleaned.

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant.

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip.

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

Loved this hotel. The location is superb, as are the facilities. The front desk staff are a credit to the hotel. They are so helpful and welcoming. Would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to others.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to review our property on Trip Advisor. We were sorry to hear that you were extremely disappointed with your recent stay and we are concerned that your room was not properly cleaned.

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators.

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

We were sorry to hear that you were extremely disappointed with your recent stay and we are concerned that your room was not properly cleaned.

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

We were sorry to hear that you were extremely disappointed with your recent stay and we are concerned that your room was not properly cleaned.

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

We look forward to having you stay with us again in the future. Mahalo

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to review our property on Trip Advisor. We were sorry to hear that you were extremely disappointed with your recent stay and we are concerned that your room was not properly cleaned.

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

Loved this hotel. The location is superb, as are the facilities. The front desk staff are a credit to the hotel. They are so helpful and welcoming. Would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to others.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day.

Loved this hotel. The location is superb, as are the facilities. The front desk staff are a credit to the hotel. They are so helpful and welcoming. Would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to others.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

We were sorry to hear that you were extremely disappointed with your recent stay and we are concerned that your room was not properly cleaned.

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks!

The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

Loved this hotel. The location is superb, as are the facilities. The front desk staff are a credit to the hotel. They are so helpful and welcoming. Would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to others.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon.

Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

Loved this hotel. The location is superb, as are the facilities. The front desk staff are a credit to the hotel. They are so helpful and welcoming. Would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to others.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything.

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

Loved this hotel. The location is superb, as are the facilities. The front desk staff are a credit to the hotel. They are so helpful and welcoming. Would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to others.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

Loved this hotel. The location is superb, as are the facilities. The front desk staff are a credit to the hotel. They are so helpful and welcoming. Would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to others.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us!

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby.

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

Loved this hotel. The location is superb, as are the facilities. The front desk staff are a credit to the hotel. They are so helpful and welcoming. Would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to others.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops.

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

Loved this hotel. The location is superb, as are the facilities. The front desk staff are a credit to the hotel. They are so helpful and welcoming. Would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to others.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to review our property on Trip Advisor. We were sorry to hear that you were extremely disappointed with your recent stay and we are concerned that your room was not properly cleaned.

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant.

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip.

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

Loved this hotel. The location is superb, as are the facilities. The front desk staff are a credit to the hotel. They are so helpful and welcoming. Would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to others.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to review our property on Trip Advisor. We were sorry to hear that you were extremely disappointed with your recent stay and we are concerned that your room was not properly cleaned.

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators.

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

We were sorry to hear that you were extremely disappointed with your recent stay and we are concerned that your room was not properly cleaned.

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

We were sorry to hear that you were extremely disappointed with your recent stay and we are concerned that your room was not properly cleaned.

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

It was a last minute decision to extend our stay, and we are very glad we did. The hotel staff that greeted us was extremely pleasant and the check-in process was smooth and quick. The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

Room 345 We booked this hotel through a Hawaiian Airlines Package, as such, did not expect much. After the Hurricanes prompted us to change travel dates, we were happy to learn the hotel changed our dates with no fuss at all. Upon arrival, we found the hotel very clean and extremely friendly! The room was large, however, a somewhat small to mid sized bathroom, with a large balcony overlooking the courtyard with glimpses of the sea. Overall, our experience with this hotel was the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, sometimes going out of their way to help with any problems we had. Room was clean, room service was completed properly, only drawback was bathroom size. Room Tip: #345 was well positioned, only noise was from day-time service room next door. See more room tips

Room was dirty and not clean when we checked in. The room had a bad smell and the balcony door would not open. The housekeeping is terrible in this hotel. When we walked in the room for the first time I seen clothing on the chair from the previous guest and a open coke bottle half way under the bed. The linens where dirty so I had to request a linen change because there where hairs on the sheets and pillows. They gave us two free breakfast buffets for the mishap. I rented the room for 8 days and by the 5 day I had to call down to housekeeping to beg them to change my linens. This incident no free buffets. The staff is not friendly at all. They had contruction outside the hotel which woke us up at 6;30 AM every morning.I would not recommend this hotel at all.. Not worth the money or time of feeling secure when sleeping in bed with dirty linens and towels

Staying at this hotel was great! We booked a room with a king bed & partial ocean view for $152 per night. Though the price was a tad steep, being able to see the ocean from our balcony made it all worth it! The hotel has a lot excursion offices in the lobby, so if you're looking to go parasailing or manta ray snorkeling, just head downstairs. This hotel is situated in the middle of the Kona pier, so you're within walking distance of great restaurants and great shopping (Ross, Pier 1, Macy's, etc). We did not opt to pre-pay for breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and i'm glad. The buffet is $21.95 per person, but this does not include drinks! They have great menu options, and even with a mimosa, you'll still save $$. All in all, this is a wonderful hotel. I will be staying here the next time i'm in Kona.

The hotel underwent a very well-done renovation a few years ago. It is now a modern, comfortable hotel. The pool and beach are great, and the pool bar is also good. There are so many restaurant choices just down the street that there is no need to eat in the hotel. Breakfast is good but I have had better elsewhere in Hawaii - including in the cafe next to the shop downstairs.

Aloha, Thank you for your review and recommendation. Weâre glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay as well as our pool and beach area. We appreciate your compliments for our hotel renovations. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mahalo

Good 3 star hotel in perfect location. Nice room with partial Oceanview. Parking just 14 bucks/night. Pool and beach OK. No ressort fee. A lot of restaurants and shopping possibilities just around the corner.

Location is absolutely superb Just stayed for four nights. Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too noisy, and need to be 4th to 6th floor to get away from noise. If not oceanfront, avoid the ice machine and the elevators. Reception - quite good, we got the guy who didn't want to be there, others were great. Beds - very good Showers - good Room in general - very good The adjacent beach - does function well as a small beach, outriggers train from their early morning, absolutely beautiful large manicured grassed area to laze on Pool - can be idyllic, well designed and good bar/food. Come Friday afternoon all went wrong - was as though hotel was filling up unsold rooms to locals at budget rates and they came to party, pool busy and rowdy and went from tranquil and quite unpleasant. Eating out - sushi night here very good, lots of good eating nearby Heat - suggest get up before 6am, walk the street, go for a swim, retire and relax 12 to 3. Evenings around town are vey pleasant, everything closes quite early. Parking - $14/night. Ask reception, free reasonably safe parking nearby. Some good shops in lobby ABC store onsite is excellent for light meals, drinks, gifts Room Tip: Took some excellent advice and booked an oceanfront room, WEST WING 5th floor. Yes, East wing too no...

The rooms were comfortable - beds, linens, ... You are located on the ocean in a protected area so it was easy for children and parents to enjoy themselves. First time snorkeling for the children was made easy due to this. There are water sporting equipment near by for rent, if you wanted. Otherwise you could float and enjoy the ocean. Being right in town, the location is prime. I would recommend this to any one.

This hotel is simply amazing. It is located right on the beach and they created there own sandy beach as that is actually a rarity on the Big Island as I unfortunately discovered during our vacation. We had an oceanfront room and the view was just incredible, we were able to see the luau grounds, the cove, the beach and boats going and coming. Whenever the surf would kick up some we could also hear the roar of the waves crashing on rocks which is great. The beds were very comfortable and the room seemed to be new or remodeled. We also had the breakfast buffet after reading a previous review that you should book a room that includes the buffet. I wholeheartedly second that opinion. The breakfast buffet the next morning had a great variety. I visited the made to order omelet man a couple times. It is definitely the best option we found short of going to Costco and buying food for yourself to save some money. If on vacation that may not be the option you wish to take. There are a lot of little stores within and nearby to the hotel. I recommend crossing the street as the shops seemed very overprices to me with the exception of the ABC store which is a great stop should you forget any basics. The absolute BEST quality of this hotel is the SERVICE! The absolute best groups among them were the Bell Hops (boys). I was out of smaller bills when we checked in as I had forgot to budget for tips required by porters who assisted my disabled mother at the airport and in the quick pace of the vacation I just didn't get any smaller bills. The point is I asked to take the luggage rack to the room myself as I did not want to use their service without being able to tip. Well then I did not return it back to them right away which unknown to me put them in a bit of a bind as it was very busy and they needed all of the people and equipment they had. One of them very nicely approached me and asked where I had left the cart when I was waiting in line for the luau. At the moment I was a bit annoyed, but looking back I now understand and think the entire thing put my needs as a customer first while also doing they could to help the other customers arriving. I should have said this first about the Bell Hops. After checking out of the hotel they stored our luggage in the hotel for us as we took a 12 hour tour and were switching hotels to the Hilton Resort which we spent the majority of our time at. While loading that luggage late in the evening I had inadvertently left a package of macadamia nuts on their desk. They actually ran down the road after our car trying to get it returned to us! Who does that these days! When they didn't catch us they ran back to front desk and had us called within 2 blocks of leaving the hotel. I find this simply amazing. I did not find an unpleasant hotel staff in entire place from housekeeping through front desk. The luau that is held their was our top activity in the ten days we were their and we did almost everything. If you are considering staying here I may be able to provide a discount that I used for my stay. I would stay there again with or without a discount booking.

We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger Hawaii honeymoon. The location is excellent, at the end of the main road through Kona â a great little town with plenty of shops, bars and good restaurants. The room was large, comfortable and reasonably well appointed with two comfy beds, large flatscreen TV, and very fast free WiFi. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bay. The room was clean and serviced daily. There is plenty of parking available in the secured car park, and quite reasonably priced for the USA. There is so much to do on the Big Island that we really used the hotel as a base for exploring â for which it is well located. Those who intend to spend their days by the pool may find it on the small side given the size of the hotel, although we never actually had a problem getting a lounger at any time of day. There is also a small private beach with a protected bay which looked great for kids. The poolside bar was good fun while the restaurant was decent. The hotel has its own small general store and coffee shop which is rather convenient. We had a great stay and if we are ever to travel the 7,200 miles to the Big Island again, then we will consider staying here. Mahalo.
