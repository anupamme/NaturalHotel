This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around.

The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing.

For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead.

Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead.

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead.

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week.

Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more.

I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery.

Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead.

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft.

That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary.

You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants).

When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny.

The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies).

I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome.

The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead.

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower.

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously.

This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of.

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite.

Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead.

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't.

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests!

The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke).

This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen.

The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead.

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach.

It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday.

They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around.

The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing.

For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead.

Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead.

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead.

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week.

Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more.

I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery.

Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead.

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft.

That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary.

You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants).

When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny.

The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies).

I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome.

The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead.

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower.

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :"you can order a sandwich to go". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants). You just have to know what to expect. Room Tip: Choose the rooms that are in the vicinity of the adults-only pool -- a lot quieter! See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai with your son. I am happy to hear that you found this to be a great resort with wonderful food. Each Four Seasons property definitely has a different "vibe" and many of our guests agree with you that Four Seasons Bora Bora is a tropical paradise. There are many families who visit with us during the summer months, Festive Season and spring break, which does mean a more boisterous atmosphere. I hope you will visit with us again when children are back in school so you can enjoy the peace and tranquility Hualalai has to offer. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything I can do to assist you. Again, mahalo for writing! With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Our three night stay was the finest hotel experience we've had to date. Impeccable grounds, beautifully appointed spacious rooms (with complimentary L'Occitane natural beauty products), stunning ocean views and memorable cuisine helped make this an unforgettable holiday. Servers on the beach attend to your every need. Seasoned travellers should experience this hotel at least once - sheer bliss!

This four seasons is a standout even when compared to other four seasons resorts. The location is gorgeous, the staff are superb, and the amenities are the best I have ever experienced. It manages to be very family friendly right down to the kids names spelled out in bath sponges in the bath suite on arrival. While at the same time still feeling like a grown up resort. They cater to your every whim. Forgot your sunscreen? No problem they have it at the pool. Sun Glasses smudged? They make rounds to clean them poolside. plus afternoon fresh fruit, kiddie ice creams, cool water spritzes all complimentary. That said it is a very expensive resort but for a real treat it is worth the extra mortgage. Green Features: They are trying to be greener. They have largely omitted green grass lawns in favor of xeriscape. There maybe more opportunities for improvement.

Aloha! In my opinion, you pointed out one of the things that makes Four Seasons Resort Hualalai Resort so special. With the widespread layout of our resort, there is a spot for every category guest - people traveling with their family, single travelers, couples with no children, honeymooners, young and old. Even though our occupancies run high, no one feels crowded and I am happy to hear that we pampered you! Thank you for your lovely review. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years to come. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the "I'm sleeping on the cloud bed" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night . We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use ! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies. I was very sad to leave this magical place. Room Tip: All rooms are great See more room tips

Greetings from Hualalai! I am so happy to hear that you and your spouse enjoyed this beautiful, magical resort and we thank you for taking the time to highlight a few of your favorite things. Even the wild life, turtles, monk seals, whales and dolphins are drawn to the Hualalai magic. We look forward to welcoming you back many times in the months and years ahead. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

You get what you pay for at the four seasons. It's expensive but the property is designed like a little village with tons of lush trees surrounding it. The ocean is right there and turtles come right up to the beach everyday to sleep. The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen. This is first class all the way. Saving up to return! Room Tip: If you want more quiet get a room near the lagoon but be prepared for a walk to the amenities. If yo... See more room tips

Our 3-member family traveled to the Four Seasons in August 2014, just missing the two hurricanes that hit Hawaii during this time. We had a great time at this resort, although it is very expensive. Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite. Service was very good and employees were very friendly. Also very close to airport (10-minute drive).

this resort is located in Big Island Hawai and no doubt that Four Seasons has done a fantastic job transforming this "lava" location in the best resort in Hawai and for sure one of the best worldwide. I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you. The sea water is clear and clean.Of course you cannot have budget constrains to relax at FS Hualalai but definately is one of the best FS beach resorts. Room Tip: ask for a room with sea view.

We have now stayed here three times (fall 2011,2012, and 2013) and have planned our return trip for November of 2014. Each year we contemplate going somewhere new but end up deciding there really isn't anything else we enjoy more than returning to hualalai. From the moment we arrive at the airport and the staff is waiting to assist with bags from the moment we leave and they are waving goodbye we feel completely relaxed and taken care of. We have stayed in the golf ocean room, a golf ocean suite and a pool side room and there really isnt a bad spot on the property just different perspectives. Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants. There isn't enough praise I could give to the staff including front desk, golf shop, pool, restaurant and housekeeping. Everyone has been flawless and attentive without being overbearing. They seem to truly want to accommodate your requests. If you are thinking about going, just book it. It's worth every penny. There is nothing better than sitting at the beach tree with a glass of wine watching the sun go down hearing the hawaiian band. Its our happy place and we are counting down the days until we return.

Greetings from your Happy Place, Hualalai! We sincerely appreciate your continued patronage and the compliments you heaped on our property and staff. I can attest to the fact that our employees do indeed enjoy working at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai; therefore, happy staff = happy guests! We cannot wait to welcome you back in November when we promise to do our best to build another wonderful memory. With warmest aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

How can you NOT give this 5 stars? It deserves at least 10 in my book. The resort has everything you can possibly imagine, and more. I have stayed in the resort itself and also in a private residence within the resort. I enjoyed the amenities offered by the Four Seasons at both. I would recommend going to the quiet pool for some nice rest and recovery. Just be warned that by quiet they mean silent and you will be asked to leave and go to the less quiet pool if you have a conversation. They take quiet seriously! I love it here and cannot wait to go back again.

Greetings from Hualalai! And we cannot wait to welcome you back! This beautiful resort has a place for everyone - kids playing in the Sea Shell pool, families snorkeling in King's Pond and people looking for peace and quiet happily sitting at the Palm Grove pool. I am so happy you love it here - hurry back! With tons of aloha, Rheba Crane Executive Administrative Assistant

I have been to this property twice and everything about it is perfection. Though the Big Island is not my favorite Hawaiian island, the Four Seasons Resort Haulalai is a show stopper! The pools, the beach, the restaurants, the spa, and of course the staff, are wonderful. When I am stressed out and tightly wound, I still close my eyes and think of this property and the absolutely relaxing and peaceful time that I had there!

We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The "but" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more "harried" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking "How many in the group?" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer. So I don't think it is the hotel's "fault" it has a different "vibe" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously.
