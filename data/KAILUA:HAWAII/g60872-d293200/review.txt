The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view.

I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods.

A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too.

The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation.

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant.

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset!

While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it.

While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts.

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay.

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it.

Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts.

We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate.

The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good.

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing.

Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation.

If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff.

While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it.

While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts.

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay.

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it.

Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts.

We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate.

The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good.

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing.

Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation.

If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff. Room Tip: Always try and get an ocean view room See more room tips Green Features: you can get a $5.00/day credit for food/drink or 500 SPG points if you refuse housekeeping and laundry of towels;

Aloha Daniel, Mahalo for taking the time to write about the fantastic vacation you had at our resort. We're so glad that you enjoyed the scenic views and your dining experience/ambiance at Rays! We look forward to hosting you again. Warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Have stayed here a few times since I like to try and stick with Starwood properties and it's the only one in Kona. It's usually nice. Had a bad experience this past trip with miscommunication among the staff there, causing me to delay my morning almost an hour. I left really frustrated. However, the manager emailed me and offered his apologies and a complimentary upgrade on my next stay. The rooms are a little old and could use some renovation. Parking is a little far away from the entrance. The views are really nice. They offer room service now, but it comes in doggie bags and not very good. The spa is nice - I got an outdoor massage by Helen. She is awesome!

Hi AlohaGirl86, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience with us. While I'm happy to hear that you're a loyal Starwood member and that the manager followed up with you after the incident, it disappoints me to hear about your overall negative experience that was not up to par with your expectations. We are currently working on our In Room menu, and hope to have new choices the next time you come back for your upgraded room! Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to discuss your trip in more detail. Sincerely, Katie Vanes PR manager

Best thing: excellent pool area, just the thing to come back to after a busy and active day. Worst thing: pretty much everything else. Room cleaning was very poor indeed, food and drink on site is hugely overpriced and thereâs not a lot of choice, staff were not particularly friendly or helpful (hint: if we request something be brought up to our room, please knock and wait for a response rather than just charging in unannounced). Overall itâs OK value for money. Donât expect anything special just because itâs a resort and definitely keep in mind the ridiculous âresort feeâ youâll be charged at checkout. I know this seems to be a standard practice, but personally Iâd prefer it to be added to the basic room charge. $30 a day for a parking space, 2 bottles of water a day, free local phone calls and a few other bits and bobs just comes across as absurd to me.

Aloha Chris, Mahalo for providing us with your valuable insight on your recent stay with us. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our fabulous pool, but it's disappointing to learn that you were not satisfied with the rest of your stay. Regarding the staff entering your room in the way that you described, this is certainly not our standard, and I'm sorry we failed you. I will be sure to bring this up to management. I see there were several other concerns; please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com to let us know how we can do better. Kind regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I selected this hotel because I wanted one that was close to, or had easy access to, the main centre. I have been bitterly disappointed. The trolley bus only operates every two hours which doesn't really make it a great transport system. There is nothing in walking distance - no alternative eating places or access to grocery shop without hiring a car (which we did for two days and was fantastic). This we rented from the hotel which was very convenient. The hotel I think is overpriced (as others have said). The $31 per night resort fee isn't really worth it. The games room is a bit tired. The accommodation rooms are clean but are in need of a renovation and definitely not 5 star. The room service food was terrible (actually the worse we have had anywhere) we ordered a Romaine salad which was literally a few lettuce leaves, two cherry tomatoes and a stale crouton. And the dressing tasted like it had fish sauce in it (my daughter and I are vegetarians). We couldn't eat it. The cheese flat bread would have been OK had it come to us hot (or even warm!) but it was cold and tasted like cardboard. And it was all very expensive (a can of sprite was $5). My husband (meat eater and usually not fussy at all) couldn't finish the burger. On the plus side - the wifi works well and the staff are friendly. The highlight of the resort is undoubtably the pool. It is huge, has a slide, a waterfall, a little beach area for toddlers and a hottub. My children loved it. But I would not recommend this hotel as a five star experience and definitely not value for money. Green Features: You can choose to go "eco-green" which means leaving your towels unchanged.

Aloha SassyCeremonies, First of all, let me say thank you for providing your valuable, detailed feedback on your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona. While we're happy to hear that your overall staff service was friendly and the wi-fi worked well -- and that you enjoyed the pool -- I am saddened to hear about your disappointment with our location and room service options. Regarding the location, were you able to make it up to the Keauhou Shopping Center? It's less than a mile from our resort and has nice restaurants with an ocean view, a movie theater and more! Our trolley is complimentary for our guests, but we will consider increasing its frequency. And there are many activities to do right on historic Keauhou Bay such as canoe paddling, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boarding and swimming. We're also sorry to hear about your in-room dining experience. That is unacceptable, and we will look into our portion sizes and ensure that all of our meals are fresh. The next time you make it back to Sheraton Kona, let us offer you a complimentary dinner with our new menu from Rays on the Bay. I noticed there were several other issues during your stay. Please feel free to email me directly at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may discuss other ways we can improve our services. Aloha, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

My husband and I visited the Sheraton Kona on our honeymoon last week. The trip started out a little rocky, but ended well! They first "upgraded" us to a view of the parking lot on the second floor right next to the elevator which was loud all night. We then found a lizard in our room! They sent someone to catch it, but we were still uneasy staying in that room. We spoke with Veronica the next day who was AWESOME. She moved us to a room with a view of the bay, conveniently on the same floor as the lobby. From then on, our trip was great. The lobby is beautiful, there's plenty of activities and things to see, and the pool is beautiful! The bathrooms in the guest rooms could use a little updating, but other than that our stay was great. Thanks to Veronica! Room Tip: Upgrading to an ocean view is worth it. "mountain view" and "partial ocean view&quot... See more room tips Green Features: I don't have any knowledge about the hotel's environmentally-friendly practices, and honestly when I'm on vacation, I'm not really worried about it.

Thank you for recently staying with us at the Sheraton Kona and for providing us with your valuable insight. We're so happy to learn that Veronica was able to assist you and help with your every need. Being in the tropics, lizards and other pests are an ongoing issue for most hotels. We have our hotel on an aggressive remediation program with our national Starwood vendor Ecolab and do everything possible to stop their intrusion into the resort. We'll step up our efforts. Should you wish to contact me directly, my email is kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com. Mahalo again for staying with us at the Sheraton Kona. Regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

We selected this hotel for our Big Island vacation this year since Keauhou Beach Hotel closed last October. For the price, the Sheraton was very disappointing. Resort fee $30/day - for services that are standard in other Kona hotels. Roll-away bed is $65/day - again free at other hotels. Rooms need updating - low water pressure and weak air conditioning. Staff was friendly and nice, setting is good though a bit of a drive if you want to get food other than the very pricy hotel fair. Overall, I would expect more for a hotel of this quality, especially if you are paying a significant resort fee on top of your booking rate. Room Tip: Most rooms have good view, so selecting one is not a problem See more room tips

Aloha Steve, Thank you for recently staying here with us at the Sheraton Kona, and for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback. I am sorry to hear that you had such a disappointing experience at our resort. While we're glad to hear that the service was friendly, we're disappointed to hear that you were overall not satisfied. Regarding the resort charge, we have bundled all of our ancillary charges into one simple resort fee instead of applying many different charges. We feel that daily water, internet, parking, 60-minute calls, trolley and cultural programs are of tremendous value and end up saving guests time and money. These charges are never hidden and are fully disclosed on all of your channels -- if this wasn't the case, would you please email me at kathryn.vanes@sheraton.com so we may remedy the error? I would also like to discuss the other items with you personally. Best regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

The hotel is located about thirty minutes away from the airport depending on the route that is taken. There are no strip malls or large malls within walking distance of the hotel. There is a local tram that stops at the hotel about once every two hour that makes several stops on the way to the city. There is also a regional bus that makes limited stops in the area and the city. This bus stops on the main road at the entrance to the driveway to the hotel. If you miss the tram or do not want to wait for the next tram the local area bus stops near the hotel. Check with the driver before boarding to make sure the route will drop you off near the hotel. The regional buses have route to different locations on the island and do not run that frequently. There is a small mall with five minutes of the hotel with a movie theatre with many shops, market, drug store and several restaurants. A fifteen minutes drive to the cities with the large shopping areas and local restaurant. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by Dori in the early afternoon. Dori advised us that only one room was available and she would let us know when the second room would be available. I found that Dori and Sally who assisted us at checkout to be the most helpful and friendly to speak to. Our rooms were next to each other with an ocean view. The bathroom has a shower tub combination and a toilet in one room. Outside of the bathroom there is a wash basin and a long counter top to lay out all the personal items. The room was a fair side with a large work table top for computers. The table had plenty of outlets with a power strip on the side of the table. The Internet speed was very good. The cloth closet and dresser were adequate size. There was one small end table between the two beds. There are two large pools connected by a small bridge located in the main area of the hotel. There is a water slide connected to one of the pools. We had the morning buffet everyday at the hotel. Cathleen the restaurant seated us the first day. We were also seat by Mehana one of the hostess. We were always seated promptly. The servers made sure that we were well taken care of. The full buffet had an omelet station with a whole section of hot foods. Room Tip: Try to get an ocean view room for the best view of the ocean and the coastline. See more room tips

Hi George, Mahalo for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor about your stay with us at the Sheraton Kona. I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed everything about your stay, from the pool to the excellent service in our food & beverage outlets. We look forward to hosting you again! Regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

I am a doorman at The Beverly Hilton Hotel < Forty Years > and I am very cognizant of good and poor service. My wife and I had the good fortune to book our hotel stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed our seven day stay. The service from the guys out front who helped with our luggage and parking the car to the front desk when we checked in gave us a clue to how well we were going to be taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge Yuki booked two tee times for us at the best golf courses, got us tickets to the hotels luau and booked reservations to Rays At The Bay Restaurant. She also gave us maps and great directions to the places we wanted to explore on the Island. Our waiter Ben at Rays At The Bay was excellent too. The property is open air everywhere you go which is very enjoyable. The pool is very nice too. Our room was beautiful and relaxing. A hotel is really just a big house with a big kitchen and a lot of bedrooms. What makes it great are the people who make us feel at home even though we are thousands of miles away from home. Matt the General Manager has guided this property to be a gem on the Big Island of Hawaii! I highly recommend the hotel! Room Tip: Try for an ocean view See more room tips

Hi Larry, First of all, congratulations on making 40 years in the hospitality industry. We are honored that you and your wife chose the Sheraton Kona as your resort during your Hawaii vacation. I'm glad to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay, and you felt well taken care of. We look forward to hosting you again! Best regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

Lovely big rooms, comfy beds, nice and quiet for sleeping. Beautiful views over the bay and the pool area was great. Food at Rays was a little pricey for what it was, nothing special. Saw a manta ray on the fourth night of trying. I think the snorkelling boats which congregate each evening in the area just outside Rays have spoiled it for the bar/restaurant. The manta rays can't be seen whilst the boats are there and the rest of my family gave up in the end. Loved the Lei making and the Ukulele lessons. The Luau was fun, made the most of the Mai Tais! Resort fee soon added up as we needed two rooms for our family, and considering that we only had parking for one car and didn't use the courtesy bus at all it wasn't good value. Maybe one resort fee per family would be more fair

Aloha Sheila, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us at Sheraton Kona. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed seeing the manta rays, our spacious rooms and the complimentary lei making and ukulele lessons. Mahalo for your insight about the resort fee. While this typically provides our guests with great value, I can see how it makes sense to charge one fee per family -- I will bring this up with our management team. We look forward to hosting you all again on your next Hawaii vacation. Warm regards, Katie Vanes, PR Manager

I don't regret booking this hotel for my family holiday. We stayed here for 6 days and there is a $30 resort charge for each night. The resort charge includes a parking spot. If you go to the big island you need to rent a car to get around. Booked the car with discounthawaiicarrental and had a decent rental car. The grounds are nice and there have been a few face lifts around the hotel. Price of food is expensive so would take the car and drive to the shopping centre nearby or to kona for food outside the resort. The rooms were spacious but could really do with a makeover. Relaxing in big island and not as busy as waikiki for sure. Pleasant stay indeed! Even saw the manta rays swimming near the rays on the bay restaurant. Room Tip: they charge you for a ocean view... charge for anything really. See more room tips Green Features: Don't bother. They take $5 off any food establishment you go to in the resort if you ask them not to change your sheets.. but with everything overpriced the $5 makes little difference.

Aloha, Thank you for taking the time to provide your valuable feedback to us about your recent stay at the Sheraton Kona, That's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and were able to see manta rays at Rays on the Bay. It truly is a unique dining experience. Like most hotels in Hawaii, we feel that this resort fee provides our customers with great value instead of pricing items out separately such as our trolley rides to Kona Village, cultural activities, etc. We hope to have you back soon to create new memories of Keauhou! With warm regards, Katie Vanes PR Manager

The Sheraton Kona is great for families as well as couples! Situated right on the ocean, it offers great views of Mauna Loa & Mauna Kea, as well as an awesome sunset! Large, comfortable rooms, several dining options (I really like the ambiance and food at Ray's) and friendly staff.
