The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room.

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room.

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean.

The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room.

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed.

The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room. Room Tip: Note: you have to pay $10/day for parking as it is hard to find parking outside. See more room tips

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room. Room Tip: Note: you have to pay $10/day for parking as it is hard to find parking outside. See more room tips

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping.

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room.

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room. Room Tip: Note: you have to pay $10/day for parking as it is hard to find parking outside. See more room tips

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv.

Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room. Room Tip: Note: you have to pay $10/day for parking as it is hard to find parking outside. See more room tips

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room. Room Tip: Note: you have to pay $10/day for parking as it is hard to find parking outside. See more room tips

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired.

The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room. Room Tip: Note: you have to pay $10/day for parking as it is hard to find parking outside. See more room tips

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side.

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room.

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price.

When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room.

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room.

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted.

I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room.

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation.

Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room. Room Tip: Note: you have to pay $10/day for parking as it is hard to find parking outside. See more room tips

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room. Room Tip: Note: you have to pay $10/day for parking as it is hard to find parking outside. See more room tips

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv.

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room. Room Tip: Note: you have to pay $10/day for parking as it is hard to find parking outside. See more room tips

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room. Room Tip: Note: you have to pay $10/day for parking as it is hard to find parking outside. See more room tips

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room. Room Tip: Note: you have to pay $10/day for parking as it is hard to find parking outside. See more room tips

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room.

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room.

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels.

The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room.

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap.

Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room.

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room. Room Tip: Note: you have to pay $10/day for parking as it is hard to find parking outside. See more room tips

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping.

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room.

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room. Room Tip: Note: you have to pay $10/day for parking as it is hard to find parking outside. See more room tips

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv.

Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room. Room Tip: Note: you have to pay $10/day for parking as it is hard to find parking outside. See more room tips

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room. Room Tip: Note: you have to pay $10/day for parking as it is hard to find parking outside. See more room tips

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired.

The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room. Room Tip: Note: you have to pay $10/day for parking as it is hard to find parking outside. See more room tips

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side.

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room.

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price.

When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room.

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room.

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted.

I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room.

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation.

Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room. Room Tip: Note: you have to pay $10/day for parking as it is hard to find parking outside. See more room tips

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room. Room Tip: Note: you have to pay $10/day for parking as it is hard to find parking outside. See more room tips

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv.

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room. Room Tip: Note: you have to pay $10/day for parking as it is hard to find parking outside. See more room tips

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room. Room Tip: Note: you have to pay $10/day for parking as it is hard to find parking outside. See more room tips

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips

The hotel location is nice... few miles from the airport. Hotel service was good, when we checked in, our room has a bathroom problem and they quickly sent plumbers to clean it and offered us another room. Room Tip: Note: you have to pay $10/day for parking as it is hard to find parking outside. See more room tips

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Room Tip: Note: you have to pay $10/day for parking as it is hard to find parking outside. See more room tips

Aloha TA family, brief and to the point, though appears despite the initial inconvenience, they were able to enjoy their Kona vacation. Taking full advantage of the best location in Kona, great views, friendly staff, and overall great ambiance. Glad they enjoyed, Mahalo!

The location of the hotel is just spectacular, right on the beach, watching the waves crash in on the rocks. The room was a great size and we had a corner verandah which gave us views in both directions. Enjoyed the close proximity to all the little shops and many restaurants. The decor is a little aged, but it was very clean and comfortable. We were a little disappointed that there was no free WiFi and that we had to pay $10 to park. We found all staff very happy and helpful. Breakfast by the water was a great highlight....(the little birds think so too) good selection from the buffet at a reasonable price. Would stay there again.

I booked an oceanfront room and got an outdated room with a side view of the ocean. It was not a clear view and we had a very obstructed view of the ocean. The room was large enough, but the beds are small. We had three in our room and were supplied one bar of soap and two towels. The beds are listed as double, I think is kind of like the room was listed as oceanfront. I was going to measure the beds and include that in this review as I had a tape measure in to ensure I met airline requirements. Turns out our airline was not enforcing their luggage listings. In any event I did not, but stand by the fact that two people will probably not be comfortable in one of the double beds. I called and asked to upgrade, but that was not an option as the other rooms have only one king bed and I was staying with both my mother and wife. So, the staff brought us a rollout bed that was actually a little smaller. So each of us slept in one bed. When they brought us the bed they also had the foresight to bring us two more towels and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and another bar of soap. The hotel has no microwave and the ice machine was broken on the second floor. So again staff came though and brought us a microwave when I called to ask where I could find one. The bathroom was small, the tub was small and had those annoying anti slip strips. If you are one that likes soaking in a tub, you will not like this one. The shower had a lot of pressure, given I had and actually still have a sunburn at the stay the pressure was painful and the settings can't be adjusted. Did I mention everything is very old and dated? I recommend to not stay here. I definitely will not. The one thing I really did like was the late check out that is standard of Noon.

We stayed here for three nights & found the views to be amazing, although the sound of surf hitting rocks all night could become annoying, especially as the doors are not really sound-proof. The room was large, but looking a bit on the tired side. The balcony was a good size, carpetted, but ot offering much privacy from next door. Bathroom was addequate, but lighting was not very good & we had a leak from the ceiling that took them two days to repair. We were offered alternative accommodation, but as we only had 1 night left, it wasnt worth moving. Instead, our parking fee was refunded, so at least there was some aknowledgement of the situation. Although the rooms need some work on them, the communial areas are lovely, especially the reception & surrounding landscaping. The hotel is conveniently located for local restaurants, convenience stores & gift shops as well as some more high end shopping. I would only return if the rooms were refurbished, but the prices would probably go up as well. The main issue with this hotel is not related to itself, but the location on the island. Kona is a good 3 hours drive each way from the southern volcanic tourist areas, so Hilo would be a better location for those sites. Kona however is great for water activities & the airport is not as busy as Hilo. In summary, if you are looking for a relatively cheap sea-side get-away & not viewing volcanoes, the Royal Kona would probably be ok for you.

Great location right on the ocean, saw dolphins from lanai. Room was clean, staff at front desk helpful. Walked to restaurants downtown. Did not eat at restaurant, I thought prices were a little high. Did have a Mai Tai which the hotel is known for and it was nasty! Would have liked to see book in room that told about hotel - i.e. menus for restaurants, pool towels available at front desk, price of luau, exactly what the hotel offered. Did not know had to pay $10 a day just to park in parking lot for rental car. Stayed in Bay tower 5th floor and air conditioner was very noisy, couldn't hardly hear the tv. Room Tip: We stayed in Bay tower, did not hear outdoor noise from bands. See more room tips

The Royal Kona Resort is located right on the ocean. We could watch dolphins, whales and manta rays from our large lanai. It's close to town, we walked to several different restaurants for dinner. The staff was helpful, our room was clean, but nothing about the resort is outstanding. We ate at the bar and found that the food was good and priced about the same most of the local places. Our room was outdated and the resort as a whole could use some upgrades, but it was pretty good for the price and the location is great. There's a $10 charge is you want Wi-Fi in your room, but it's free at the lobby and bar area. Many of the local cafes also had free Wi-Fi, so I recommend saving the $

I stayed here about 10 years ago and came back in July 2014. I chose this place again for the location is great and place was great. Well location still great, the resort is tired and aged in that 10 years, and yet staff were helpful, ambience was great, the breakfast was plentiful and the bar by the water was great. We were upgraded to a corner room with views, and we loved it. We could hear the waves crashing against the rocks below, which we loved. The room was huge, but very tired. The balcony was two sides and great to sit out there and watch the sun over the water. The tour guide there from Expedia was exceptional and knew her stuff. if you want to be by the ocean, close to all the restaurants and cafe's and don't mind tired, then this is a great place. The bed was very comfy, the air conditioning worked, the bar area great, the rock pool amazing, the gardens beautiful, the shops lovely, the view awesome, the surrounding grounds beautiful.

Comfortable and clean room with a large balcony to enjoy scenic ocean front view. Buffet breakfast was good but servers' service was slightly on the slow side. The restrooms in the lobby should be cleaned more frequent. There should be more signs directing to their facilities eg. Salt water dip. Room Tip: Choose ocean front view on the highest floor. The view is absolutely worth it. See more room tips

I really enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel and the staff was very helpful . Upon my arrival I was upgraded to an ocean view room. The room was very big with a large lanai where you could sit outside and enjoy the view. you could walk around the grounds and enjoy the pool and the very small beach which is a protected area. Just a short walk to town where you had a good choice of restaurant and cute little stores very enjoyable. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was pricey and not very good, it really was not worth it. I would recommend this hotel, the price is right and the staff is great. Room Tip: get a view of the ocean See more room tips
