Recently stayed here, 8/1-8/8. We found the unit to be quite comfortable. I told the Activities desk that we were not interested in the timeshare presentation and it was never brought up again. The only issue I had was that with Iselle approaching the island of Hawaii, we had to initiate contact with the staff regarding their emergency plan for guests. We would definitely stay here again.

Aloha, Thank you for your review for Kona Hawaiian resort. And we look forward for you next visit. Mahalo

Wyndham Kona Coast location is next door to- the Ocean so if you want Ocean front you are going to have to walk across the street! Excellent room size ( all rooms are 2 bedrooms/2 bath) plus a giant size kitchen with all the bells and whistles! The resorts grounds are kept perfect by happy worker bees that clean up every am! This is a great resort for a family and if you like to walk to the town of kona is only about 18 minutes! The resorts has several Gas Grills if you want to cook outside! We did not attempt to attend any activities at the resort because we had activities to attend off site! Lots of restaurants to eat at but i would highly recommend The Lava-Java for breakfast! The cinnamon bun is to die for!!! The pools are nice and clean but a little small but you are going to the Ocean anyway Right!!!! If you need anything the resort will attempt to help you with Good Choices for where to go for what you are wanting to accomplish ! The internet is ok in the am but spotty after 4:00 when everyone starts coming back from Hilo or other sights on the Big Island! The timeshare pitch (we were staying 2 weeks) so i missed it or wife must of made them aware that we were on VACATION! Remember to enjoy the sights and get a Car Rental ! You DO NOT need a 4 wheel drive to enjoy 98% of the Big Island! The Wyndham Kona Coast is a MUST STAY if you are going to Kona! The family cannot wait till we can return to the Big Island and i am proud to say " i would stay here again" and would recommend this Resort to family and friends without hesitation ! P.S. Get out there and enjoy the Big Island !!!!!!!! Room Tip: Ask to be placed up the hill as far as possible! If not, you will be looking at a White tent! See more room tips Green Features: You are in Hawaii so Everyone is into the environment! If you go to Costco or WalMart you will need to bring bags or buy a bag for .30 cents!

Aloha, I thank you for the wonderful review for Kona Hawaiian resort. And thank you for sharing great travel tips for everyone planning their Hawaiian vacation. Mahalo.

Excellent room size (2 bedroom/2 bath), nice beds, lanai, well-supplied condominium, air-conditioning, and 2 televisions. Overall, very nice accommodations. The grounds provide for a Hawaiian garden experience. It is a beautiful resort. Areas for improvement would include larger-sized pools (2), Internet service (Internet was slow to non-existent at times, weekly activities (redundant and of low quality), fitness facility (small and dated), poolside bar (it was not functioning during our stay), and timeshare sales pitches (Don't pitch Club Wyndham when a guest is simply asking for directions or entertainment advice). Kona is a fantastic place. The waters are simply astonishing regarding warmth and clarity. We would return to Kona in a heartbeat. Prior to staying at Wyndham Kona again, I would expect some significant upgrades to the resort.

Aloha, Great to hear that you enjoyed our spacious 2 -bedroom accomadations and other amenities and facilities offered. Thank you for this feedback for Kona Hawaiian. This will allow us to continue to enhance the vacation experience at our resort and to know other opportunities to improve to make your stay better in the future. Mahalo.

Nice in all respects. Across the street from the coast. 15 minute walk from downtown (aka no need to drive after some umbrella drinks...). Very nice, condo-style units -- spacious with kitchen and family room. Nice pools. Clean/well-maintained. Only negative is that they try to sell you more timeshare points and excursions pretty hard -- think this is normal for timeshare places. The excursions are through Expedia and are high quality,

Aloha, Great to hear abour your experience staying at Kona Hawaiian resort. I thank you for your comments, and we'll share it with all staff. We look forward for your vacation. Mahalo.

Stayed here in June 2014 with our family of 6, including twenty-somethings. Had a unit up the hill where it was really quiet and everyone enjoyed the sleep! Resort is handy to everything. Great kitchen for all of the chefs to work around one another! Rooms were clean and the washer/dryer was essential for washing and drying beach towels after the beach trips! key factor: the resort keeps a hut full of beach paraphernalia - no need to go to Costco or Walmart for chairs or umbrellas! Resort pool (upper) clean and gorgeous views. It would have been really nice to be able to order a cocktail, but there is no tiki bar and anyway that was not essential. We loved the big island and encourage others to stay here and take advantage of the location - near Kona and able to walk to shop or dinners, easy drive to any beach on the west side of the island, easy to get to the "cloud forest" for coffee tour, and easy to drive to Mauna Kea and Hilo. Highly recommend the helicopter tour of the island. Beautiful. Room Tip: Upstairs units on the hill are quieter and have a view of the ocean. See more room tips

Aloha, Thank you for the great feedback for Kona Hawaiian. Great to hear that all family members enjoyed Hawaiian vacation including the resort accommodation. We look forward to your next visit. Mahalo.

Location was perfect for quiet and peaceful vacation. Close to amenities - just a short walk away or jump in the car for snorkeling. Really appreciated the staff here...Reasonably priced in comparison to several hotels without kitchens in the units.

Aloha, Thank you very much for sharing your wonderful experience at the resort. we are glad that you and your family had enjoy the Island adventure. Mahalo,

Recently stayed here for 7 nights and overall we're very pleased. After looking at photos online and reviews I was skeptical about choosing this resort. Upon arrival and check in, the unit and resort exceeded my expectations. Large unit with updated furniture and well stocked kitchenware...non stick pan was super. Two minor complaints... the only dining table was outside and there were lots of flies, insects. Possible screening in would help. Also, pools were small and kids were bored. That said, we didn't spend a whole lot of time in unit or at pools. Would return again. Room Tip: Second floor to void noise. See more room tips

Aloha, It's was a pleasure to have you as our guest here in the resort, thank you very much for all the wonderful words that you experience with us. We are glad that we meet your expectation to our resort. We love to see you here again. Mahalo

Stayed here July 2014. Units have nice layout but the furniture is old and uncomfortable. The carpet is old and I wonder why in a place near sandy beaches it isn't tiled anyway. The spa tub in the master bedroom is one of those like in the dial is commercials... Only one person can get in at a time... The grounds were pretty. The staff were friendly. Pools were small but ok. Location is not on the beach and across the street the beach is rocky so you have to drive to sandy beach area. Otherwise location is short drive distance to grocery and restaurants nearby. Room Tip: Blogs are two stories with stair access to upper units. If stairs are a challenge ask for lower lev... See more room tips

Aloha, Thank you kindly for all the wonderful words that you shared to us it's greatly appreciated. The resort is close to the beach and all the restaurant is only a minutes away. As for the units they've been renovated 5 years ago with new carpets and furnitures. Mahalo,

We booked this resort through a Hawaiian Airlines package deal. I thought that the price was incredible for the room quality. Our family of six attended (three adults/three kids) and we had a two bedroom/two bath condo. We arrived at the hotel pretty early in the morning (around 8:30am). We were told that check-in wasn't until 4pm and no rooms were currently available, however, the lady wrote down my cell phone number and said that she would call as soon as a room became available. The lady offered to store our luggage for us, too. It was around noon that I got a call from the front desk, stating that our room was ready. I thought that the space of the unit was perfect, and the layout was also great. The six of us slept comfortably in the room. I've read some reviews that state the internet isn't the greatest. I can vouch for that. The internet isn't the greatest, but I didn't mind. It was actually nice to break away from technology for a few days and enjoy our vacation. The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that we weren't told (upon check-in), that our room wouldn't be serviced while we were there. I found out on our third day (by reading the information book in the room), that the rooms were only serviced mid-week. If you want clean towels you have to wash them yourself with the laundry detergent provided in the room. I guess if you want more shampoo/conditioner, you need to go to the front desk and request that. I didn't mind washing our towels, but it would have been helpful if I had known upon check-in that our room wasn't going to be serviced. I would definitely stay there again.

Aloha, We greatly appreciate all the wonderful comments that you gave us during your stay in Kona hawaiian resort. We apologize about the internet connection that occur during your stay. Mahalo,

This is a very nice Kona Resort. The units are spacious and out room was immaculate upon checking in. Found it to be very quiet also, which I don't think I've ever experienced before in a "timeshare resort". The timeshare presentation was typical of most. Not a whole lot of pressure and the presenters were polite. My one and only complaint about the resort had to do with their wi-fi. It is absolutely horrible, AT&T is the provider and they just guaranteed me not switching to them because of the shoddy experience I had with it here at the resort. And they can't blame it on being in Kona. I stayed one night at the Royal Kona while here and the wifi was excellent... So Wyndham, please get your act together on this. As it stands now, I won't be coming back because I need access to the internet and I don't like having to find some place else in town to enjoy it. Plus when using my smartphone it kept exiting the wifi connection due to "slow connection times" so unbeknownst to me when I thought I was using my wifi on my phone, it was actually pulling from my data usage. Luckily, I caught it and turned off my phone. In the 4 days I've spent here so far, it had managed to eat up 75% of my data plan, because the wifi was exited. Oh and one other thing.. when I went to use the dryer, there were some articles of clothing from the previous guest still in there along with a bandaid! Apparently the service staff doesn't check the washer and dryers.. so be prepared... Also no direct beach access, so be prepared to drive if you want to get to the beach.

Thank you for this great feedback. This will allow us to continue to enhance the vacation experience at our resort. Mahalo.

If you need anything the resort will attempt to help you with Good Choices for where to go for what you are wanting to accomplish ! The internet is ok in the am but spotty after 4:00 when everyone starts coming back from Hilo or other sights on the Big Island! The timeshare pitch (we were staying 2 weeks) so i missed it or wife must of made them aware that we were on VACATION! Remember to enjoy the sights and get a Car Rental ! You DO NOT need a 4 wheel drive to enjoy 98% of the Big Island! The Wyndham Kona Coast is a MUST STAY if you are going to Kona! The family cannot wait till we can return to the Big Island and i am proud to say " i would stay here again" and would recommend this Resort to family and friends without hesitation ! P.S. Get out there and enjoy the Big Island !!!!!!!! Room Tip: Ask to be placed up the hill as far as possible! If not, you will be looking at a White tent! See more room tips Green Features: You are in Hawaii so Everyone is into the environment! If you go to Costco or WalMart you will need to bring bags or buy a bag for .30 cents!

Aloha, I thank you for the wonderful review for Kona Hawaiian resort. And thank you for sharing great travel tips for everyone planning their Hawaiian vacation. Mahalo.

Excellent room size (2 bedroom/2 bath), nice beds, lanai, well-supplied condominium, air-conditioning, and 2 televisions. Overall, very nice accommodations. The grounds provide for a Hawaiian garden experience. It is a beautiful resort. Areas for improvement would include larger-sized pools (2), Internet service (Internet was slow to non-existent at times, weekly activities (redundant and of low quality), fitness facility (small and dated), poolside bar (it was not functioning during our stay), and timeshare sales pitches (Don't pitch Club Wyndham when a guest is simply asking for directions or entertainment advice). Kona is a fantastic place. The waters are simply astonishing regarding warmth and clarity. We would return to Kona in a heartbeat. Prior to staying at Wyndham Kona again, I would expect some significant upgrades to the resort.

Aloha, Great to hear that you enjoyed our spacious 2 -bedroom accomadations and other amenities and facilities offered. Thank you for this feedback for Kona Hawaiian. This will allow us to continue to enhance the vacation experience at our resort and to know other opportunities to improve to make your stay better in the future. Mahalo.

Nice in all respects. Across the street from the coast. 15 minute walk from downtown (aka no need to drive after some umbrella drinks...). Very nice, condo-style units -- spacious with kitchen and family room. Nice pools. Clean/well-maintained. Only negative is that they try to sell you more timeshare points and excursions pretty hard -- think this is normal for timeshare places. The excursions are through Expedia and are high quality,

Aloha, Great to hear abour your experience staying at Kona Hawaiian resort. I thank you for your comments, and we'll share it with all staff. We look forward for your vacation. Mahalo.

Stayed here in June 2014 with our family of 6, including twenty-somethings. Had a unit up the hill where it was really quiet and everyone enjoyed the sleep! Resort is handy to everything. Great kitchen for all of the chefs to work around one another! Rooms were clean and the washer/dryer was essential for washing and drying beach towels after the beach trips! key factor: the resort keeps a hut full of beach paraphernalia - no need to go to Costco or Walmart for chairs or umbrellas! Resort pool (upper) clean and gorgeous views. It would have been really nice to be able to order a cocktail, but there is no tiki bar and anyway that was not essential. We loved the big island and encourage others to stay here and take advantage of the location - near Kona and able to walk to shop or dinners, easy drive to any beach on the west side of the island, easy to get to the "cloud forest" for coffee tour, and easy to drive to Mauna Kea and Hilo. Highly recommend the helicopter tour of the island. Beautiful. Room Tip: Upstairs units on the hill are quieter and have a view of the ocean. See more room tips

Aloha, Thank you for the great feedback for Kona Hawaiian. Great to hear that all family members enjoyed Hawaiian vacation including the resort accommodation. We look forward to your next visit. Mahalo.

Location was perfect for quiet and peaceful vacation. Close to amenities - just a short walk away or jump in the car for snorkeling. Really appreciated the staff here...Reasonably priced in comparison to several hotels without kitchens in the units.

Aloha, Thank you very much for sharing your wonderful experience at the resort. we are glad that you and your family had enjoy the Island adventure. Mahalo,

Recently stayed here for 7 nights and overall we're very pleased. After looking at photos online and reviews I was skeptical about choosing this resort. Upon arrival and check in, the unit and resort exceeded my expectations. Large unit with updated furniture and well stocked kitchenware...non stick pan was super. Two minor complaints... the only dining table was outside and there were lots of flies, insects. Possible screening in would help. Also, pools were small and kids were bored. That said, we didn't spend a whole lot of time in unit or at pools. Would return again. Room Tip: Second floor to void noise. See more room tips

Aloha, It's was a pleasure to have you as our guest here in the resort, thank you very much for all the wonderful words that you experience with us. We are glad that we meet your expectation to our resort. We love to see you here again. Mahalo

Stayed here July 2014. Units have nice layout but the furniture is old and uncomfortable. The carpet is old and I wonder why in a place near sandy beaches it isn't tiled anyway. The spa tub in the master bedroom is one of those like in the dial is commercials... Only one person can get in at a time... The grounds were pretty. The staff were friendly. Pools were small but ok. Location is not on the beach and across the street the beach is rocky so you have to drive to sandy beach area. Otherwise location is short drive distance to grocery and restaurants nearby. Room Tip: Blogs are two stories with stair access to upper units. If stairs are a challenge ask for lower lev... See more room tips

Aloha, Thank you kindly for all the wonderful words that you shared to us it's greatly appreciated. The resort is close to the beach and all the restaurant is only a minutes away. As for the units they've been renovated 5 years ago with new carpets and furnitures. Mahalo,

We booked this resort through a Hawaiian Airlines package deal. I thought that the price was incredible for the room quality. Our family of six attended (three adults/three kids) and we had a two bedroom/two bath condo. We arrived at the hotel pretty early in the morning (around 8:30am). We were told that check-in wasn't until 4pm and no rooms were currently available, however, the lady wrote down my cell phone number and said that she would call as soon as a room became available. The lady offered to store our luggage for us, too. It was around noon that I got a call from the front desk, stating that our room was ready. I thought that the space of the unit was perfect, and the layout was also great. The six of us slept comfortably in the room. I've read some reviews that state the internet isn't the greatest. I can vouch for that. The internet isn't the greatest, but I didn't mind. It was actually nice to break away from technology for a few days and enjoy our vacation. The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that we weren't told (upon check-in), that our room wouldn't be serviced while we were there. I found out on our third day (by reading the information book in the room), that the rooms were only serviced mid-week. If you want clean towels you have to wash them yourself with the laundry detergent provided in the room. I guess if you want more shampoo/conditioner, you need to go to the front desk and request that. I didn't mind washing our towels, but it would have been helpful if I had known upon check-in that our room wasn't going to be serviced. I would definitely stay there again.

Aloha, We greatly appreciate all the wonderful comments that you gave us during your stay in Kona hawaiian resort. We apologize about the internet connection that occur during your stay. Mahalo,

This is a very nice Kona Resort. The units are spacious and out room was immaculate upon checking in. Found it to be very quiet also, which I don't think I've ever experienced before in a "timeshare resort". The timeshare presentation was typical of most. Not a whole lot of pressure and the presenters were polite. My one and only complaint about the resort had to do with their wi-fi. It is absolutely horrible, AT&T is the provider and they just guaranteed me not switching to them because of the shoddy experience I had with it here at the resort. And they can't blame it on being in Kona. I stayed one night at the Royal Kona while here and the wifi was excellent... So Wyndham, please get your act together on this. As it stands now, I won't be coming back because I need access to the internet and I don't like having to find some place else in town to enjoy it. Plus when using my smartphone it kept exiting the wifi connection due to "slow connection times" so unbeknownst to me when I thought I was using my wifi on my phone, it was actually pulling from my data usage. Luckily, I caught it and turned off my phone. In the 4 days I've spent here so far, it had managed to eat up 75% of my data plan, because the wifi was exited. Oh and one other thing.. when I went to use the dryer, there were some articles of clothing from the previous guest still in there along with a bandaid! Apparently the service staff doesn't check the washer and dryers.. so be prepared... Also no direct beach access, so be prepared to drive if you want to get to the beach.

Thank you for this great feedback. This will allow us to continue to enhance the vacation experience at our resort. Mahalo.

Recently stayed here, 8/1-8/8. We found the unit to be quite comfortable. I told the Activities desk that we were not interested in the timeshare presentation and it was never brought up again. The only issue I had was that with Iselle approaching the island of Hawaii, we had to initiate contact with the staff regarding their emergency plan for guests. We would definitely stay here again.

Aloha, Thank you for your review for Kona Hawaiian resort. And we look forward for you next visit. Mahalo

Wyndham Kona Coast location is next door to- the Ocean so if you want Ocean front you are going to have to walk across the street! Excellent room size ( all rooms are 2 bedrooms/2 bath) plus a giant size kitchen with all the bells and whistles! The resorts grounds are kept perfect by happy worker bees that clean up every am! This is a great resort for a family and if you like to walk to the town of kona is only about 18 minutes! The resorts has several Gas Grills if you want to cook outside! We did not attempt to attend any activities at the resort because we had activities to attend off site! Lots of restaurants to eat at but i would highly recommend The Lava-Java for breakfast!

Aloha, I thank you for the wonderful review for Kona Hawaiian resort. And thank you for sharing great travel tips for everyone planning their Hawaiian vacation. Mahalo.

Excellent room size (2 bedroom/2 bath), nice beds, lanai, well-supplied condominium, air-conditioning, and 2 televisions. Overall, very nice accommodations. The grounds provide for a Hawaiian garden experience. It is a beautiful resort. Areas for improvement would include larger-sized pools (2), Internet service (Internet was slow to non-existent at times, weekly activities (redundant and of low quality), fitness facility (small and dated), poolside bar (it was not functioning during our stay), and timeshare sales pitches (Don't pitch Club Wyndham when a guest is simply asking for directions or entertainment advice). Kona is a fantastic place. The waters are simply astonishing regarding warmth and clarity. We would return to Kona in a heartbeat. Prior to staying at Wyndham Kona again, I would expect some significant upgrades to the resort.

Aloha, Great to hear that you enjoyed our spacious 2 -bedroom accomadations and other amenities and facilities offered. Thank you for this feedback for Kona Hawaiian. This will allow us to continue to enhance the vacation experience at our resort and to know other opportunities to improve to make your stay better in the future. Mahalo.

Nice in all respects. Across the street from the coast. 15 minute walk from downtown (aka no need to drive after some umbrella drinks...). Very nice, condo-style units -- spacious with kitchen and family room. Nice pools. Clean/well-maintained. Only negative is that they try to sell you more timeshare points and excursions pretty hard -- think this is normal for timeshare places. The excursions are through Expedia and are high quality,

Aloha, Great to hear abour your experience staying at Kona Hawaiian resort. I thank you for your comments, and we'll share it with all staff. We look forward for your vacation. Mahalo.

Stayed here in June 2014 with our family of 6, including twenty-somethings. Had a unit up the hill where it was really quiet and everyone enjoyed the sleep! Resort is handy to everything. Great kitchen for all of the chefs to work around one another! Rooms were clean and the washer/dryer was essential for washing and drying beach towels after the beach trips! key factor: the resort keeps a hut full of beach paraphernalia - no need to go to Costco or Walmart for chairs or umbrellas! Resort pool (upper) clean and gorgeous views. It would have been really nice to be able to order a cocktail, but there is no tiki bar and anyway that was not essential. We loved the big island and encourage others to stay here and take advantage of the location - near Kona and able to walk to shop or dinners, easy drive to any beach on the west side of the island, easy to get to the "cloud forest" for coffee tour, and easy to drive to Mauna Kea and Hilo. Highly recommend the helicopter tour of the island. Beautiful. Room Tip: Upstairs units on the hill are quieter and have a view of the ocean. See more room tips

Aloha, Thank you for the great feedback for Kona Hawaiian. Great to hear that all family members enjoyed Hawaiian vacation including the resort accommodation. We look forward to your next visit. Mahalo.

Location was perfect for quiet and peaceful vacation. Close to amenities - just a short walk away or jump in the car for snorkeling. Really appreciated the staff here...Reasonably priced in comparison to several hotels without kitchens in the units.

Aloha, Thank you very much for sharing your wonderful experience at the resort. we are glad that you and your family had enjoy the Island adventure. Mahalo,

Recently stayed here for 7 nights and overall we're very pleased. After looking at photos online and reviews I was skeptical about choosing this resort. Upon arrival and check in, the unit and resort exceeded my expectations. Large unit with updated furniture and well stocked kitchenware...non stick pan was super. Two minor complaints... the only dining table was outside and there were lots of flies, insects. Possible screening in would help. Also, pools were small and kids were bored. That said, we didn't spend a whole lot of time in unit or at pools. Would return again. Room Tip: Second floor to void noise. See more room tips

Aloha, It's was a pleasure to have you as our guest here in the resort, thank you very much for all the wonderful words that you experience with us. We are glad that we meet your expectation to our resort. We love to see you here again. Mahalo

Stayed here July 2014. Units have nice layout but the furniture is old and uncomfortable. The carpet is old and I wonder why in a place near sandy beaches it isn't tiled anyway. The spa tub in the master bedroom is one of those like in the dial is commercials... Only one person can get in at a time... The grounds were pretty. The staff were friendly. Pools were small but ok. Location is not on the beach and across the street the beach is rocky so you have to drive to sandy beach area. Otherwise location is short drive distance to grocery and restaurants nearby. Room Tip: Blogs are two stories with stair access to upper units. If stairs are a challenge ask for lower lev... See more room tips

Aloha, Thank you kindly for all the wonderful words that you shared to us it's greatly appreciated. The resort is close to the beach and all the restaurant is only a minutes away. As for the units they've been renovated 5 years ago with new carpets and furnitures. Mahalo,

We booked this resort through a Hawaiian Airlines package deal. I thought that the price was incredible for the room quality. Our family of six attended (three adults/three kids) and we had a two bedroom/two bath condo. We arrived at the hotel pretty early in the morning (around 8:30am). We were told that check-in wasn't until 4pm and no rooms were currently available, however, the lady wrote down my cell phone number and said that she would call as soon as a room became available. The lady offered to store our luggage for us, too. It was around noon that I got a call from the front desk, stating that our room was ready. I thought that the space of the unit was perfect, and the layout was also great. The six of us slept comfortably in the room. I've read some reviews that state the internet isn't the greatest. I can vouch for that. The internet isn't the greatest, but I didn't mind. It was actually nice to break away from technology for a few days and enjoy our vacation. The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that we weren't told (upon check-in), that our room wouldn't be serviced while we were there. I found out on our third day (by reading the information book in the room), that the rooms were only serviced mid-week. If you want clean towels you have to wash them yourself with the laundry detergent provided in the room. I guess if you want more shampoo/conditioner, you need to go to the front desk and request that. I didn't mind washing our towels, but it would have been helpful if I had known upon check-in that our room wasn't going to be serviced. I would definitely stay there again.

Aloha, We greatly appreciate all the wonderful comments that you gave us during your stay in Kona hawaiian resort. We apologize about the internet connection that occur during your stay. Mahalo,

This is a very nice Kona Resort. The units are spacious and out room was immaculate upon checking in. Found it to be very quiet also, which I don't think I've ever experienced before in a "timeshare resort". The timeshare presentation was typical of most. Not a whole lot of pressure and the presenters were polite. My one and only complaint about the resort had to do with their wi-fi. It is absolutely horrible, AT&T is the provider and they just guaranteed me not switching to them because of the shoddy experience I had with it here at the resort. And they can't blame it on being in Kona. I stayed one night at the Royal Kona while here and the wifi was excellent... So Wyndham, please get your act together on this. As it stands now, I won't be coming back because I need access to the internet and I don't like having to find some place else in town to enjoy it. Plus when using my smartphone it kept exiting the wifi connection due to "slow connection times" so unbeknownst to me when I thought I was using my wifi on my phone, it was actually pulling from my data usage. Luckily, I caught it and turned off my phone. In the 4 days I've spent here so far, it had managed to eat up 75% of my data plan, because the wifi was exited. Oh and one other thing.. when I went to use the dryer, there were some articles of clothing from the previous guest still in there along with a bandaid! Apparently the service staff doesn't check the washer and dryers.. so be prepared... Also no direct beach access, so be prepared to drive if you want to get to the beach.

Thank you for this great feedback. This will allow us to continue to enhance the vacation experience at our resort. Mahalo.

Recently stayed here, 8/1-8/8. We found the unit to be quite comfortable. I told the Activities desk that we were not interested in the timeshare presentation and it was never brought up again. The only issue I had was that with Iselle approaching the island of Hawaii, we had to initiate contact with the staff regarding their emergency plan for guests. We would definitely stay here again.

Aloha, Thank you for your review for Kona Hawaiian resort. And we look forward for you next visit. Mahalo

Wyndham Kona Coast location is next door to- the Ocean so if you want Ocean front you are going to have to walk across the street! Excellent room size ( all rooms are 2 bedrooms/2 bath) plus a giant size kitchen with all the bells and whistles! The resorts grounds are kept perfect by happy worker bees that clean up every am! This is a great resort for a family and if you like to walk to the town of kona is only about 18 minutes! The resorts has several Gas Grills if you want to cook outside! We did not attempt to attend any activities at the resort because we had activities to attend off site! Lots of restaurants to eat at but i would highly recommend The Lava-Java for breakfast! The cinnamon bun is to die for!!! The pools are nice and clean but a little small but you are going to the Ocean anyway Right!!!! If you need anything the resort will attempt to help you with Good Choices for where to go for what you are wanting to accomplish ! The internet is ok in the am but spotty after 4:00 when everyone starts coming back from Hilo or other sights on the Big Island! The timeshare pitch (we were staying 2 weeks) so i missed it or wife must of made them aware that we were on VACATION! Remember to enjoy the sights and get a Car Rental ! You DO NOT need a 4 wheel drive to enjoy 98% of the Big Island! The Wyndham Kona Coast is a MUST STAY if you are going to Kona! The family cannot wait till we can return to the Big Island and i am proud to say " i would stay here again" and would recommend this Resort to family and friends without hesitation ! P.S.

Kona is a fantastic place. The waters are simply astonishing regarding warmth and clarity. We would return to Kona in a heartbeat. Prior to staying at Wyndham Kona again, I would expect some significant upgrades to the resort.

Aloha, Great to hear that you enjoyed our spacious 2 -bedroom accomadations and other amenities and facilities offered. Thank you for this feedback for Kona Hawaiian. This will allow us to continue to enhance the vacation experience at our resort and to know other opportunities to improve to make your stay better in the future. Mahalo.

Nice in all respects. Across the street from the coast. 15 minute walk from downtown (aka no need to drive after some umbrella drinks...). Very nice, condo-style units -- spacious with kitchen and family room. Nice pools. Clean/well-maintained. Only negative is that they try to sell you more timeshare points and excursions pretty hard -- think this is normal for timeshare places. The excursions are through Expedia and are high quality,

Aloha, Great to hear abour your experience staying at Kona Hawaiian resort. I thank you for your comments, and we'll share it with all staff. We look forward for your vacation. Mahalo.

Stayed here in June 2014 with our family of 6, including twenty-somethings. Had a unit up the hill where it was really quiet and everyone enjoyed the sleep! Resort is handy to everything. Great kitchen for all of the chefs to work around one another! Rooms were clean and the washer/dryer was essential for washing and drying beach towels after the beach trips! key factor: the resort keeps a hut full of beach paraphernalia - no need to go to Costco or Walmart for chairs or umbrellas! Resort pool (upper) clean and gorgeous views. It would have been really nice to be able to order a cocktail, but there is no tiki bar and anyway that was not essential. We loved the big island and encourage others to stay here and take advantage of the location - near Kona and able to walk to shop or dinners, easy drive to any beach on the west side of the island, easy to get to the "cloud forest" for coffee tour, and easy to drive to Mauna Kea and Hilo. Highly recommend the helicopter tour of the island. Beautiful. Room Tip: Upstairs units on the hill are quieter and have a view of the ocean. See more room tips

Aloha, Thank you for the great feedback for Kona Hawaiian. Great to hear that all family members enjoyed Hawaiian vacation including the resort accommodation. We look forward to your next visit. Mahalo.

Location was perfect for quiet and peaceful vacation. Close to amenities - just a short walk away or jump in the car for snorkeling. Really appreciated the staff here...Reasonably priced in comparison to several hotels without kitchens in the units.

Aloha, Thank you very much for sharing your wonderful experience at the resort. we are glad that you and your family had enjoy the Island adventure. Mahalo,

Recently stayed here for 7 nights and overall we're very pleased. After looking at photos online and reviews I was skeptical about choosing this resort. Upon arrival and check in, the unit and resort exceeded my expectations. Large unit with updated furniture and well stocked kitchenware...non stick pan was super. Two minor complaints... the only dining table was outside and there were lots of flies, insects. Possible screening in would help. Also, pools were small and kids were bored. That said, we didn't spend a whole lot of time in unit or at pools. Would return again. Room Tip: Second floor to void noise. See more room tips

Aloha, It's was a pleasure to have you as our guest here in the resort, thank you very much for all the wonderful words that you experience with us. We are glad that we meet your expectation to our resort. We love to see you here again. Mahalo

Stayed here July 2014. Units have nice layout but the furniture is old and uncomfortable. The carpet is old and I wonder why in a place near sandy beaches it isn't tiled anyway. The spa tub in the master bedroom is one of those like in the dial is commercials... Only one person can get in at a time... The grounds were pretty. The staff were friendly. Pools were small but ok. Location is not on the beach and across the street the beach is rocky so you have to drive to sandy beach area. Otherwise location is short drive distance to grocery and restaurants nearby. Room Tip: Blogs are two stories with stair access to upper units. If stairs are a challenge ask for lower lev... See more room tips

Aloha, Thank you kindly for all the wonderful words that you shared to us it's greatly appreciated. The resort is close to the beach and all the restaurant is only a minutes away. As for the units they've been renovated 5 years ago with new carpets and furnitures. Mahalo,

We booked this resort through a Hawaiian Airlines package deal. I thought that the price was incredible for the room quality. Our family of six attended (three adults/three kids) and we had a two bedroom/two bath condo. We arrived at the hotel pretty early in the morning (around 8:30am). We were told that check-in wasn't until 4pm and no rooms were currently available, however, the lady wrote down my cell phone number and said that she would call as soon as a room became available. The lady offered to store our luggage for us, too. It was around noon that I got a call from the front desk, stating that our room was ready. I thought that the space of the unit was perfect, and the layout was also great. The six of us slept comfortably in the room. I've read some reviews that state the internet isn't the greatest. I can vouch for that. The internet isn't the greatest, but I didn't mind. It was actually nice to break away from technology for a few days and enjoy our vacation. The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that we weren't told (upon check-in), that our room wouldn't be serviced while we were there. I found out on our third day (by reading the information book in the room), that the rooms were only serviced mid-week. If you want clean towels you have to wash them yourself with the laundry detergent provided in the room. I guess if you want more shampoo/conditioner, you need to go to the front desk and request that. I didn't mind washing our towels, but it would have been helpful if I had known upon check-in that our room wasn't going to be serviced. I would definitely stay there again.

Aloha, We greatly appreciate all the wonderful comments that you gave us during your stay in Kona hawaiian resort. We apologize about the internet connection that occur during your stay. Mahalo,

This is a very nice Kona Resort. The units are spacious and out room was immaculate upon checking in. Found it to be very quiet also, which I don't think I've ever experienced before in a "timeshare resort". The timeshare presentation was typical of most. Not a whole lot of pressure and the presenters were polite. My one and only complaint about the resort had to do with their wi-fi. It is absolutely horrible, AT&T is the provider and they just guaranteed me not switching to them because of the shoddy experience I had with it here at the resort. And they can't blame it on being in Kona. I stayed one night at the Royal Kona while here and the wifi was excellent... So Wyndham, please get your act together on this. As it stands now, I won't be coming back because I need access to the internet and I don't like having to find some place else in town to enjoy it. Plus when using my smartphone it kept exiting the wifi connection due to "slow connection times" so unbeknownst to me when I thought I was using my wifi on my phone, it was actually pulling from my data usage. Luckily, I caught it and turned off my phone. In the 4 days I've spent here so far, it had managed to eat up 75% of my data plan, because the wifi was exited. Oh and one other thing.. when I went to use the dryer, there were some articles of clothing from the previous guest still in there along with a bandaid! Apparently the service staff doesn't check the washer and dryers.. so be prepared... Also no direct beach access, so be prepared to drive if you want to get to the beach.

Thank you for this great feedback. This will allow us to continue to enhance the vacation experience at our resort. Mahalo.

Recently stayed here, 8/1-8/8. We found the unit to be quite comfortable. I told the Activities desk that we were not interested in the timeshare presentation and it was never brought up again. The only issue I had was that with Iselle approaching the island of Hawaii, we had to initiate contact with the staff regarding their emergency plan for guests. We would definitely stay here again.

Aloha, Thank you for your review for Kona Hawaiian resort. And we look forward for you next visit. Mahalo

Wyndham Kona Coast location is next door to- the Ocean so if you want Ocean front you are going to have to walk across the street! Excellent room size ( all rooms are 2 bedrooms/2 bath) plus a giant size kitchen with all the bells and whistles! The resorts grounds are kept perfect by happy worker bees that clean up every am! This is a great resort for a family and if you like to walk to the town of kona is only about 18 minutes! The resorts has several Gas Grills if you want to cook outside! We did not attempt to attend any activities at the resort because we had activities to attend off site! Lots of restaurants to eat at but i would highly recommend The Lava-Java for breakfast! The cinnamon bun is to die for!!! The pools are nice and clean but a little small but you are going to the Ocean anyway Right!!!! If you need anything the resort will attempt to help you with Good Choices for where to go for what you are wanting to accomplish ! The internet is ok in the am but spotty after 4:00 when everyone starts coming back from Hilo or other sights on the Big Island! The timeshare pitch (we were staying 2 weeks) so i missed it or wife must of made them aware that we were on VACATION! Remember to enjoy the sights and get a Car Rental ! You DO NOT need a 4 wheel drive to enjoy 98% of the Big Island! The Wyndham Kona Coast is a MUST STAY if you are going to Kona! The family cannot wait till we can return to the Big Island and i am proud to say " i would stay here again" and would recommend this Resort to family and friends without hesitation ! P.S. Get out there and enjoy the Big Island !!!!!!!! Room Tip: Ask to be placed up the hill as far as possible! If not, you will be looking at a White tent! See more room tips Green Features: You are in Hawaii so Everyone is into the environment! If you go to Costco or WalMart you will need to bring bags or buy a bag for .30 cents!

Aloha, I thank you for the wonderful review for Kona Hawaiian resort. And thank you for sharing great travel tips for everyone planning their Hawaiian vacation. Mahalo.

Only negative is that they try to sell you more timeshare points and excursions pretty hard -- think this is normal for timeshare places. The excursions are through Expedia and are high quality,

Aloha, Great to hear abour your experience staying at Kona Hawaiian resort. I thank you for your comments, and we'll share it with all staff. We look forward for your vacation. Mahalo.

Stayed here in June 2014 with our family of 6, including twenty-somethings. Had a unit up the hill where it was really quiet and everyone enjoyed the sleep! Resort is handy to everything. Great kitchen for all of the chefs to work around one another! Rooms were clean and the washer/dryer was essential for washing and drying beach towels after the beach trips! key factor: the resort keeps a hut full of beach paraphernalia - no need to go to Costco or Walmart for chairs or umbrellas! Resort pool (upper) clean and gorgeous views. It would have been really nice to be able to order a cocktail, but there is no tiki bar and anyway that was not essential. We loved the big island and encourage others to stay here and take advantage of the location - near Kona and able to walk to shop or dinners, easy drive to any beach on the west side of the island, easy to get to the "cloud forest" for coffee tour, and easy to drive to Mauna Kea and Hilo. Highly recommend the helicopter tour of the island. Beautiful. Room Tip: Upstairs units on the hill are quieter and have a view of the ocean. See more room tips

Aloha, Thank you for the great feedback for Kona Hawaiian. Great to hear that all family members enjoyed Hawaiian vacation including the resort accommodation. We look forward to your next visit. Mahalo.

Location was perfect for quiet and peaceful vacation. Close to amenities - just a short walk away or jump in the car for snorkeling. Really appreciated the staff here...Reasonably priced in comparison to several hotels without kitchens in the units.

Aloha, Thank you very much for sharing your wonderful experience at the resort. we are glad that you and your family had enjoy the Island adventure. Mahalo,

Recently stayed here for 7 nights and overall we're very pleased. After looking at photos online and reviews I was skeptical about choosing this resort. Upon arrival and check in, the unit and resort exceeded my expectations. Large unit with updated furniture and well stocked kitchenware...non stick pan was super. Two minor complaints... the only dining table was outside and there were lots of flies, insects. Possible screening in would help. Also, pools were small and kids were bored. That said, we didn't spend a whole lot of time in unit or at pools. Would return again. Room Tip: Second floor to void noise. See more room tips

Aloha, It's was a pleasure to have you as our guest here in the resort, thank you very much for all the wonderful words that you experience with us. We are glad that we meet your expectation to our resort. We love to see you here again. Mahalo

Stayed here July 2014. Units have nice layout but the furniture is old and uncomfortable. The carpet is old and I wonder why in a place near sandy beaches it isn't tiled anyway. The spa tub in the master bedroom is one of those like in the dial is commercials... Only one person can get in at a time... The grounds were pretty. The staff were friendly. Pools were small but ok. Location is not on the beach and across the street the beach is rocky so you have to drive to sandy beach area. Otherwise location is short drive distance to grocery and restaurants nearby. Room Tip: Blogs are two stories with stair access to upper units. If stairs are a challenge ask for lower lev... See more room tips

Aloha, Thank you kindly for all the wonderful words that you shared to us it's greatly appreciated. The resort is close to the beach and all the restaurant is only a minutes away. As for the units they've been renovated 5 years ago with new carpets and furnitures. Mahalo,

We booked this resort through a Hawaiian Airlines package deal. I thought that the price was incredible for the room quality. Our family of six attended (three adults/three kids) and we had a two bedroom/two bath condo. We arrived at the hotel pretty early in the morning (around 8:30am). We were told that check-in wasn't until 4pm and no rooms were currently available, however, the lady wrote down my cell phone number and said that she would call as soon as a room became available. The lady offered to store our luggage for us, too. It was around noon that I got a call from the front desk, stating that our room was ready. I thought that the space of the unit was perfect, and the layout was also great. The six of us slept comfortably in the room. I've read some reviews that state the internet isn't the greatest. I can vouch for that. The internet isn't the greatest, but I didn't mind. It was actually nice to break away from technology for a few days and enjoy our vacation. The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that we weren't told (upon check-in), that our room wouldn't be serviced while we were there. I found out on our third day (by reading the information book in the room), that the rooms were only serviced mid-week. If you want clean towels you have to wash them yourself with the laundry detergent provided in the room. I guess if you want more shampoo/conditioner, you need to go to the front desk and request that. I didn't mind washing our towels, but it would have been helpful if I had known upon check-in that our room wasn't going to be serviced. I would definitely stay there again.

Aloha, We greatly appreciate all the wonderful comments that you gave us during your stay in Kona hawaiian resort. We apologize about the internet connection that occur during your stay. Mahalo,

This is a very nice Kona Resort. The units are spacious and out room was immaculate upon checking in. Found it to be very quiet also, which I don't think I've ever experienced before in a "timeshare resort". The timeshare presentation was typical of most. Not a whole lot of pressure and the presenters were polite. My one and only complaint about the resort had to do with their wi-fi. It is absolutely horrible, AT&T is the provider and they just guaranteed me not switching to them because of the shoddy experience I had with it here at the resort. And they can't blame it on being in Kona. I stayed one night at the Royal Kona while here and the wifi was excellent... So Wyndham, please get your act together on this. As it stands now, I won't be coming back because I need access to the internet and I don't like having to find some place else in town to enjoy it. Plus when using my smartphone it kept exiting the wifi connection due to "slow connection times" so unbeknownst to me when I thought I was using my wifi on my phone, it was actually pulling from my data usage. Luckily, I caught it and turned off my phone. In the 4 days I've spent here so far, it had managed to eat up 75% of my data plan, because the wifi was exited. Oh and one other thing.. when I went to use the dryer, there were some articles of clothing from the previous guest still in there along with a bandaid! Apparently the service staff doesn't check the washer and dryers.. so be prepared... Also no direct beach access, so be prepared to drive if you want to get to the beach.

Thank you for this great feedback. This will allow us to continue to enhance the vacation experience at our resort. Mahalo.

Recently stayed here, 8/1-8/8. We found the unit to be quite comfortable. I told the Activities desk that we were not interested in the timeshare presentation and it was never brought up again. The only issue I had was that with Iselle approaching the island of Hawaii, we had to initiate contact with the staff regarding their emergency plan for guests. We would definitely stay here again.

Aloha, Thank you for your review for Kona Hawaiian resort. And we look forward for you next visit. Mahalo

Wyndham Kona Coast location is next door to- the Ocean so if you want Ocean front you are going to have to walk across the street! Excellent room size ( all rooms are 2 bedrooms/2 bath) plus a giant size kitchen with all the bells and whistles! The resorts grounds are kept perfect by happy worker bees that clean up every am! This is a great resort for a family and if you like to walk to the town of kona is only about 18 minutes! The resorts has several Gas Grills if you want to cook outside! We did not attempt to attend any activities at the resort because we had activities to attend off site! Lots of restaurants to eat at but i would highly recommend The Lava-Java for breakfast! The cinnamon bun is to die for!!! The pools are nice and clean but a little small but you are going to the Ocean anyway Right!!!! If you need anything the resort will attempt to help you with Good Choices for where to go for what you are wanting to accomplish ! The internet is ok in the am but spotty after 4:00 when everyone starts coming back from Hilo or other sights on the Big Island! The timeshare pitch (we were staying 2 weeks) so i missed it or wife must of made them aware that we were on VACATION! Remember to enjoy the sights and get a Car Rental ! You DO NOT need a 4 wheel drive to enjoy 98% of the Big Island! The Wyndham Kona Coast is a MUST STAY if you are going to Kona! The family cannot wait till we can return to the Big Island and i am proud to say " i would stay here again" and would recommend this Resort to family and friends without hesitation ! P.S. Get out there and enjoy the Big Island !!!!!!!! Room Tip: Ask to be placed up the hill as far as possible! If not, you will be looking at a White tent! See more room tips Green Features: You are in Hawaii so Everyone is into the environment! If you go to Costco or WalMart you will need to bring bags or buy a bag for .30 cents!

Aloha, I thank you for the wonderful review for Kona Hawaiian resort. And thank you for sharing great travel tips for everyone planning their Hawaiian vacation. Mahalo.

Excellent room size (2 bedroom/2 bath), nice beds, lanai, well-supplied condominium, air-conditioning, and 2 televisions. Overall, very nice accommodations. The grounds provide for a Hawaiian garden experience. It is a beautiful resort. Areas for improvement would include larger-sized pools (2), Internet service (Internet was slow to non-existent at times, weekly activities (redundant and of low quality), fitness facility (small and dated), poolside bar (it was not functioning during our stay), and timeshare sales pitches (Don't pitch Club Wyndham when a guest is simply asking for directions or entertainment advice). Kona is a fantastic place. The waters are simply astonishing regarding warmth and clarity. We would return to Kona in a heartbeat. Prior to staying at Wyndham Kona again, I would expect some significant upgrades to the resort.

Aloha, Great to hear that you enjoyed our spacious 2 -bedroom accomadations and other amenities and facilities offered. Thank you for this feedback for Kona Hawaiian.

We loved the big island and encourage others to stay here and take advantage of the location - near Kona and able to walk to shop or dinners, easy drive to any beach on the west side of the island, easy to get to the "cloud forest" for coffee tour, and easy to drive to Mauna Kea and Hilo. Highly recommend the helicopter tour of the island. Beautiful. Room Tip: Upstairs units on the hill are quieter and have a view of the ocean. See more room tips

Aloha, Thank you for the great feedback for Kona Hawaiian. Great to hear that all family members enjoyed Hawaiian vacation including the resort accommodation. We look forward to your next visit. Mahalo.

Location was perfect for quiet and peaceful vacation. Close to amenities - just a short walk away or jump in the car for snorkeling. Really appreciated the staff here...Reasonably priced in comparison to several hotels without kitchens in the units.

Aloha, Thank you very much for sharing your wonderful experience at the resort. we are glad that you and your family had enjoy the Island adventure. Mahalo,

Recently stayed here for 7 nights and overall we're very pleased. After looking at photos online and reviews I was skeptical about choosing this resort. Upon arrival and check in, the unit and resort exceeded my expectations. Large unit with updated furniture and well stocked kitchenware...non stick pan was super. Two minor complaints... the only dining table was outside and there were lots of flies, insects. Possible screening in would help. Also, pools were small and kids were bored. That said, we didn't spend a whole lot of time in unit or at pools. Would return again. Room Tip: Second floor to void noise. See more room tips

Aloha, It's was a pleasure to have you as our guest here in the resort, thank you very much for all the wonderful words that you experience with us. We are glad that we meet your expectation to our resort. We love to see you here again. Mahalo

Stayed here July 2014. Units have nice layout but the furniture is old and uncomfortable. The carpet is old and I wonder why in a place near sandy beaches it isn't tiled anyway. The spa tub in the master bedroom is one of those like in the dial is commercials... Only one person can get in at a time... The grounds were pretty. The staff were friendly. Pools were small but ok. Location is not on the beach and across the street the beach is rocky so you have to drive to sandy beach area. Otherwise location is short drive distance to grocery and restaurants nearby. Room Tip: Blogs are two stories with stair access to upper units. If stairs are a challenge ask for lower lev... See more room tips

Aloha, Thank you kindly for all the wonderful words that you shared to us it's greatly appreciated. The resort is close to the beach and all the restaurant is only a minutes away. As for the units they've been renovated 5 years ago with new carpets and furnitures. Mahalo,

We booked this resort through a Hawaiian Airlines package deal. I thought that the price was incredible for the room quality. Our family of six attended (three adults/three kids) and we had a two bedroom/two bath condo. We arrived at the hotel pretty early in the morning (around 8:30am). We were told that check-in wasn't until 4pm and no rooms were currently available, however, the lady wrote down my cell phone number and said that she would call as soon as a room became available. The lady offered to store our luggage for us, too. It was around noon that I got a call from the front desk, stating that our room was ready. I thought that the space of the unit was perfect, and the layout was also great. The six of us slept comfortably in the room. I've read some reviews that state the internet isn't the greatest. I can vouch for that. The internet isn't the greatest, but I didn't mind. It was actually nice to break away from technology for a few days and enjoy our vacation. The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that we weren't told (upon check-in), that our room wouldn't be serviced while we were there. I found out on our third day (by reading the information book in the room), that the rooms were only serviced mid-week. If you want clean towels you have to wash them yourself with the laundry detergent provided in the room. I guess if you want more shampoo/conditioner, you need to go to the front desk and request that. I didn't mind washing our towels, but it would have been helpful if I had known upon check-in that our room wasn't going to be serviced. I would definitely stay there again.

Aloha, We greatly appreciate all the wonderful comments that you gave us during your stay in Kona hawaiian resort. We apologize about the internet connection that occur during your stay. Mahalo,

This is a very nice Kona Resort. The units are spacious and out room was immaculate upon checking in. Found it to be very quiet also, which I don't think I've ever experienced before in a "timeshare resort". The timeshare presentation was typical of most. Not a whole lot of pressure and the presenters were polite. My one and only complaint about the resort had to do with their wi-fi. It is absolutely horrible, AT&T is the provider and they just guaranteed me not switching to them because of the shoddy experience I had with it here at the resort. And they can't blame it on being in Kona. I stayed one night at the Royal Kona while here and the wifi was excellent... So Wyndham, please get your act together on this. As it stands now, I won't be coming back because I need access to the internet and I don't like having to find some place else in town to enjoy it. Plus when using my smartphone it kept exiting the wifi connection due to "slow connection times" so unbeknownst to me when I thought I was using my wifi on my phone, it was actually pulling from my data usage. Luckily, I caught it and turned off my phone. In the 4 days I've spent here so far, it had managed to eat up 75% of my data plan, because the wifi was exited. Oh and one other thing.. when I went to use the dryer, there were some articles of clothing from the previous guest still in there along with a bandaid! Apparently the service staff doesn't check the washer and dryers.. so be prepared... Also no direct beach access, so be prepared to drive if you want to get to the beach.

Thank you for this great feedback. This will allow us to continue to enhance the vacation experience at our resort. Mahalo.

Recently stayed here, 8/1-8/8. We found the unit to be quite comfortable. I told the Activities desk that we were not interested in the timeshare presentation and it was never brought up again. The only issue I had was that with Iselle approaching the island of Hawaii, we had to initiate contact with the staff regarding their emergency plan for guests. We would definitely stay here again.

Aloha, Thank you for your review for Kona Hawaiian resort. And we look forward for you next visit. Mahalo

Wyndham Kona Coast location is next door to- the Ocean so if you want Ocean front you are going to have to walk across the street! Excellent room size ( all rooms are 2 bedrooms/2 bath) plus a giant size kitchen with all the bells and whistles! The resorts grounds are kept perfect by happy worker bees that clean up every am! This is a great resort for a family and if you like to walk to the town of kona is only about 18 minutes! The resorts has several Gas Grills if you want to cook outside! We did not attempt to attend any activities at the resort because we had activities to attend off site! Lots of restaurants to eat at but i would highly recommend The Lava-Java for breakfast! The cinnamon bun is to die for!!! The pools are nice and clean but a little small but you are going to the Ocean anyway Right!!!! If you need anything the resort will attempt to help you with Good Choices for where to go for what you are wanting to accomplish ! The internet is ok in the am but spotty after 4:00 when everyone starts coming back from Hilo or other sights on the Big Island! The timeshare pitch (we were staying 2 weeks) so i missed it or wife must of made them aware that we were on VACATION! Remember to enjoy the sights and get a Car Rental ! You DO NOT need a 4 wheel drive to enjoy 98% of the Big Island! The Wyndham Kona Coast is a MUST STAY if you are going to Kona! The family cannot wait till we can return to the Big Island and i am proud to say " i would stay here again" and would recommend this Resort to family and friends without hesitation ! P.S. Get out there and enjoy the Big Island !!!!!!!! Room Tip: Ask to be placed up the hill as far as possible! If not, you will be looking at a White tent! See more room tips Green Features: You are in Hawaii so Everyone is into the environment! If you go to Costco or WalMart you will need to bring bags or buy a bag for .30 cents!

Aloha, I thank you for the wonderful review for Kona Hawaiian resort. And thank you for sharing great travel tips for everyone planning their Hawaiian vacation. Mahalo.

Excellent room size (2 bedroom/2 bath), nice beds, lanai, well-supplied condominium, air-conditioning, and 2 televisions. Overall, very nice accommodations. The grounds provide for a Hawaiian garden experience. It is a beautiful resort. Areas for improvement would include larger-sized pools (2), Internet service (Internet was slow to non-existent at times, weekly activities (redundant and of low quality), fitness facility (small and dated), poolside bar (it was not functioning during our stay), and timeshare sales pitches (Don't pitch Club Wyndham when a guest is simply asking for directions or entertainment advice). Kona is a fantastic place. The waters are simply astonishing regarding warmth and clarity. We would return to Kona in a heartbeat. Prior to staying at Wyndham Kona again, I would expect some significant upgrades to the resort.

Aloha, Great to hear that you enjoyed our spacious 2 -bedroom accomadations and other amenities and facilities offered. Thank you for this feedback for Kona Hawaiian. This will allow us to continue to enhance the vacation experience at our resort and to know other opportunities to improve to make your stay better in the future. Mahalo.

Nice in all respects. Across the street from the coast. 15 minute walk from downtown (aka no need to drive after some umbrella drinks...). Very nice, condo-style units -- spacious with kitchen and family room. Nice pools. Clean/well-maintained. Only negative is that they try to sell you more timeshare points and excursions pretty hard -- think this is normal for timeshare places. The excursions are through Expedia and are high quality,

Aloha, Great to hear abour your experience staying at Kona Hawaiian resort. I thank you for your comments, and we'll share it with all staff. We look forward for your vacation. Mahalo.

Stayed here in June 2014 with our family of 6, including twenty-somethings. Had a unit up the hill where it was really quiet and everyone enjoyed the sleep! Resort is handy to everything. Great kitchen for all of the chefs to work around one another!

Aloha, Thank you very much for sharing your wonderful experience at the resort. we are glad that you and your family had enjoy the Island adventure. Mahalo,

Recently stayed here for 7 nights and overall we're very pleased. After looking at photos online and reviews I was skeptical about choosing this resort. Upon arrival and check in, the unit and resort exceeded my expectations. Large unit with updated furniture and well stocked kitchenware...non stick pan was super. Two minor complaints... the only dining table was outside and there were lots of flies, insects. Possible screening in would help. Also, pools were small and kids were bored. That said, we didn't spend a whole lot of time in unit or at pools. Would return again. Room Tip: Second floor to void noise. See more room tips

Aloha, It's was a pleasure to have you as our guest here in the resort, thank you very much for all the wonderful words that you experience with us. We are glad that we meet your expectation to our resort. We love to see you here again. Mahalo

Stayed here July 2014. Units have nice layout but the furniture is old and uncomfortable. The carpet is old and I wonder why in a place near sandy beaches it isn't tiled anyway. The spa tub in the master bedroom is one of those like in the dial is commercials... Only one person can get in at a time... The grounds were pretty. The staff were friendly. Pools were small but ok. Location is not on the beach and across the street the beach is rocky so you have to drive to sandy beach area. Otherwise location is short drive distance to grocery and restaurants nearby. Room Tip: Blogs are two stories with stair access to upper units. If stairs are a challenge ask for lower lev... See more room tips

Aloha, Thank you kindly for all the wonderful words that you shared to us it's greatly appreciated. The resort is close to the beach and all the restaurant is only a minutes away. As for the units they've been renovated 5 years ago with new carpets and furnitures. Mahalo,

We booked this resort through a Hawaiian Airlines package deal. I thought that the price was incredible for the room quality. Our family of six attended (three adults/three kids) and we had a two bedroom/two bath condo. We arrived at the hotel pretty early in the morning (around 8:30am). We were told that check-in wasn't until 4pm and no rooms were currently available, however, the lady wrote down my cell phone number and said that she would call as soon as a room became available. The lady offered to store our luggage for us, too. It was around noon that I got a call from the front desk, stating that our room was ready. I thought that the space of the unit was perfect, and the layout was also great. The six of us slept comfortably in the room. I've read some reviews that state the internet isn't the greatest. I can vouch for that. The internet isn't the greatest, but I didn't mind. It was actually nice to break away from technology for a few days and enjoy our vacation. The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that we weren't told (upon check-in), that our room wouldn't be serviced while we were there. I found out on our third day (by reading the information book in the room), that the rooms were only serviced mid-week. If you want clean towels you have to wash them yourself with the laundry detergent provided in the room. I guess if you want more shampoo/conditioner, you need to go to the front desk and request that. I didn't mind washing our towels, but it would have been helpful if I had known upon check-in that our room wasn't going to be serviced. I would definitely stay there again.

Aloha, We greatly appreciate all the wonderful comments that you gave us during your stay in Kona hawaiian resort. We apologize about the internet connection that occur during your stay. Mahalo,

This is a very nice Kona Resort. The units are spacious and out room was immaculate upon checking in. Found it to be very quiet also, which I don't think I've ever experienced before in a "timeshare resort". The timeshare presentation was typical of most. Not a whole lot of pressure and the presenters were polite. My one and only complaint about the resort had to do with their wi-fi. It is absolutely horrible, AT&T is the provider and they just guaranteed me not switching to them because of the shoddy experience I had with it here at the resort. And they can't blame it on being in Kona. I stayed one night at the Royal Kona while here and the wifi was excellent... So Wyndham, please get your act together on this. As it stands now, I won't be coming back because I need access to the internet and I don't like having to find some place else in town to enjoy it. Plus when using my smartphone it kept exiting the wifi connection due to "slow connection times" so unbeknownst to me when I thought I was using my wifi on my phone, it was actually pulling from my data usage. Luckily, I caught it and turned off my phone. In the 4 days I've spent here so far, it had managed to eat up 75% of my data plan, because the wifi was exited. Oh and one other thing.. when I went to use the dryer, there were some articles of clothing from the previous guest still in there along with a bandaid! Apparently the service staff doesn't check the washer and dryers.. so be prepared... Also no direct beach access, so be prepared to drive if you want to get to the beach.

Thank you for this great feedback. This will allow us to continue to enhance the vacation experience at our resort. Mahalo.

Recently stayed here, 8/1-8/8. We found the unit to be quite comfortable. I told the Activities desk that we were not interested in the timeshare presentation and it was never brought up again. The only issue I had was that with Iselle approaching the island of Hawaii, we had to initiate contact with the staff regarding their emergency plan for guests. We would definitely stay here again.

Aloha, Thank you for your review for Kona Hawaiian resort. And we look forward for you next visit. Mahalo

Wyndham Kona Coast location is next door to- the Ocean so if you want Ocean front you are going to have to walk across the street! Excellent room size ( all rooms are 2 bedrooms/2 bath) plus a giant size kitchen with all the bells and whistles! The resorts grounds are kept perfect by happy worker bees that clean up every am! This is a great resort for a family and if you like to walk to the town of kona is only about 18 minutes! The resorts has several Gas Grills if you want to cook outside! We did not attempt to attend any activities at the resort because we had activities to attend off site! Lots of restaurants to eat at but i would highly recommend The Lava-Java for breakfast! The cinnamon bun is to die for!!! The pools are nice and clean but a little small but you are going to the Ocean anyway Right!!!! If you need anything the resort will attempt to help you with Good Choices for where to go for what you are wanting to accomplish ! The internet is ok in the am but spotty after 4:00 when everyone starts coming back from Hilo or other sights on the Big Island! The timeshare pitch (we were staying 2 weeks) so i missed it or wife must of made them aware that we were on VACATION! Remember to enjoy the sights and get a Car Rental ! You DO NOT need a 4 wheel drive to enjoy 98% of the Big Island! The Wyndham Kona Coast is a MUST STAY if you are going to Kona! The family cannot wait till we can return to the Big Island and i am proud to say " i would stay here again" and would recommend this Resort to family and friends without hesitation ! P.S. Get out there and enjoy the Big Island !!!!!!!! Room Tip: Ask to be placed up the hill as far as possible! If not, you will be looking at a White tent! See more room tips Green Features: You are in Hawaii so Everyone is into the environment! If you go to Costco or WalMart you will need to bring bags or buy a bag for .30 cents!

Aloha, I thank you for the wonderful review for Kona Hawaiian resort. And thank you for sharing great travel tips for everyone planning their Hawaiian vacation. Mahalo.

Excellent room size (2 bedroom/2 bath), nice beds, lanai, well-supplied condominium, air-conditioning, and 2 televisions. Overall, very nice accommodations. The grounds provide for a Hawaiian garden experience. It is a beautiful resort. Areas for improvement would include larger-sized pools (2), Internet service (Internet was slow to non-existent at times, weekly activities (redundant and of low quality), fitness facility (small and dated), poolside bar (it was not functioning during our stay), and timeshare sales pitches (Don't pitch Club Wyndham when a guest is simply asking for directions or entertainment advice). Kona is a fantastic place. The waters are simply astonishing regarding warmth and clarity. We would return to Kona in a heartbeat. Prior to staying at Wyndham Kona again, I would expect some significant upgrades to the resort.

Aloha, Great to hear that you enjoyed our spacious 2 -bedroom accomadations and other amenities and facilities offered. Thank you for this feedback for Kona Hawaiian. This will allow us to continue to enhance the vacation experience at our resort and to know other opportunities to improve to make your stay better in the future. Mahalo.

Nice in all respects. Across the street from the coast. 15 minute walk from downtown (aka no need to drive after some umbrella drinks...). Very nice, condo-style units -- spacious with kitchen and family room. Nice pools. Clean/well-maintained. Only negative is that they try to sell you more timeshare points and excursions pretty hard -- think this is normal for timeshare places. The excursions are through Expedia and are high quality,

Aloha, Great to hear abour your experience staying at Kona Hawaiian resort. I thank you for your comments, and we'll share it with all staff. We look forward for your vacation. Mahalo.

Stayed here in June 2014 with our family of 6, including twenty-somethings. Had a unit up the hill where it was really quiet and everyone enjoyed the sleep! Resort is handy to everything. Great kitchen for all of the chefs to work around one another! Rooms were clean and the washer/dryer was essential for washing and drying beach towels after the beach trips! key factor: the resort keeps a hut full of beach paraphernalia - no need to go to Costco or Walmart for chairs or umbrellas! Resort pool (upper) clean and gorgeous views. It would have been really nice to be able to order a cocktail, but there is no tiki bar and anyway that was not essential. We loved the big island and encourage others to stay here and take advantage of the location - near Kona and able to walk to shop or dinners, easy drive to any beach on the west side of the island, easy to get to the "cloud forest" for coffee tour, and easy to drive to Mauna Kea and Hilo. Highly recommend the helicopter tour of the island. Beautiful. Room Tip: Upstairs units on the hill are quieter and have a view of the ocean. See more room tips

Aloha, It's was a pleasure to have you as our guest here in the resort, thank you very much for all the wonderful words that you experience with us. We are glad that we meet your expectation to our resort. We love to see you here again. Mahalo

Stayed here July 2014. Units have nice layout but the furniture is old and uncomfortable. The carpet is old and I wonder why in a place near sandy beaches it isn't tiled anyway. The spa tub in the master bedroom is one of those like in the dial is commercials... Only one person can get in at a time... The grounds were pretty. The staff were friendly. Pools were small but ok. Location is not on the beach and across the street the beach is rocky so you have to drive to sandy beach area. Otherwise location is short drive distance to grocery and restaurants nearby. Room Tip: Blogs are two stories with stair access to upper units. If stairs are a challenge ask for lower lev... See more room tips

Aloha, Thank you kindly for all the wonderful words that you shared to us it's greatly appreciated. The resort is close to the beach and all the restaurant is only a minutes away. As for the units they've been renovated 5 years ago with new carpets and furnitures. Mahalo,

We booked this resort through a Hawaiian Airlines package deal. I thought that the price was incredible for the room quality. Our family of six attended (three adults/three kids) and we had a two bedroom/two bath condo. We arrived at the hotel pretty early in the morning (around 8:30am). We were told that check-in wasn't until 4pm and no rooms were currently available, however, the lady wrote down my cell phone number and said that she would call as soon as a room became available. The lady offered to store our luggage for us, too. It was around noon that I got a call from the front desk, stating that our room was ready. I thought that the space of the unit was perfect, and the layout was also great. The six of us slept comfortably in the room. I've read some reviews that state the internet isn't the greatest. I can vouch for that. The internet isn't the greatest, but I didn't mind. It was actually nice to break away from technology for a few days and enjoy our vacation. The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that we weren't told (upon check-in), that our room wouldn't be serviced while we were there. I found out on our third day (by reading the information book in the room), that the rooms were only serviced mid-week. If you want clean towels you have to wash them yourself with the laundry detergent provided in the room. I guess if you want more shampoo/conditioner, you need to go to the front desk and request that. I didn't mind washing our towels, but it would have been helpful if I had known upon check-in that our room wasn't going to be serviced. I would definitely stay there again.

Aloha, We greatly appreciate all the wonderful comments that you gave us during your stay in Kona hawaiian resort. We apologize about the internet connection that occur during your stay. Mahalo,

This is a very nice Kona Resort. The units are spacious and out room was immaculate upon checking in. Found it to be very quiet also, which I don't think I've ever experienced before in a "timeshare resort". The timeshare presentation was typical of most. Not a whole lot of pressure and the presenters were polite. My one and only complaint about the resort had to do with their wi-fi. It is absolutely horrible, AT&T is the provider and they just guaranteed me not switching to them because of the shoddy experience I had with it here at the resort. And they can't blame it on being in Kona. I stayed one night at the Royal Kona while here and the wifi was excellent... So Wyndham, please get your act together on this. As it stands now, I won't be coming back because I need access to the internet and I don't like having to find some place else in town to enjoy it. Plus when using my smartphone it kept exiting the wifi connection due to "slow connection times" so unbeknownst to me when I thought I was using my wifi on my phone, it was actually pulling from my data usage. Luckily, I caught it and turned off my phone. In the 4 days I've spent here so far, it had managed to eat up 75% of my data plan, because the wifi was exited. Oh and one other thing.. when I went to use the dryer, there were some articles of clothing from the previous guest still in there along with a bandaid! Apparently the service staff doesn't check the washer and dryers.. so be prepared... Also no direct beach access, so be prepared to drive if you want to get to the beach.

Thank you for this great feedback. This will allow us to continue to enhance the vacation experience at our resort. Mahalo.

Recently stayed here, 8/1-8/8. We found the unit to be quite comfortable. I told the Activities desk that we were not interested in the timeshare presentation and it was never brought up again. The only issue I had was that with Iselle approaching the island of Hawaii, we had to initiate contact with the staff regarding their emergency plan for guests. We would definitely stay here again.

Aloha, Thank you for your review for Kona Hawaiian resort. And we look forward for you next visit. Mahalo

Wyndham Kona Coast location is next door to- the Ocean so if you want Ocean front you are going to have to walk across the street! Excellent room size ( all rooms are 2 bedrooms/2 bath) plus a giant size kitchen with all the bells and whistles! The resorts grounds are kept perfect by happy worker bees that clean up every am! This is a great resort for a family and if you like to walk to the town of kona is only about 18 minutes! The resorts has several Gas Grills if you want to cook outside! We did not attempt to attend any activities at the resort because we had activities to attend off site! Lots of restaurants to eat at but i would highly recommend The Lava-Java for breakfast! The cinnamon bun is to die for!!! The pools are nice and clean but a little small but you are going to the Ocean anyway Right!!!! If you need anything the resort will attempt to help you with Good Choices for where to go for what you are wanting to accomplish ! The internet is ok in the am but spotty after 4:00 when everyone starts coming back from Hilo or other sights on the Big Island! The timeshare pitch (we were staying 2 weeks) so i missed it or wife must of made them aware that we were on VACATION! Remember to enjoy the sights and get a Car Rental ! You DO NOT need a 4 wheel drive to enjoy 98% of the Big Island! The Wyndham Kona Coast is a MUST STAY if you are going to Kona! The family cannot wait till we can return to the Big Island and i am proud to say " i would stay here again" and would recommend this Resort to family and friends without hesitation ! P.S. Get out there and enjoy the Big Island !!!!!!!! Room Tip: Ask to be placed up the hill as far as possible! If not, you will be looking at a White tent! See more room tips Green Features: You are in Hawaii so Everyone is into the environment! If you go to Costco or WalMart you will need to bring bags or buy a bag for .30 cents!

Aloha, I thank you for the wonderful review for Kona Hawaiian resort. And thank you for sharing great travel tips for everyone planning their Hawaiian vacation. Mahalo.

Excellent room size (2 bedroom/2 bath), nice beds, lanai, well-supplied condominium, air-conditioning, and 2 televisions. Overall, very nice accommodations. The grounds provide for a Hawaiian garden experience. It is a beautiful resort. Areas for improvement would include larger-sized pools (2), Internet service (Internet was slow to non-existent at times, weekly activities (redundant and of low quality), fitness facility (small and dated), poolside bar (it was not functioning during our stay), and timeshare sales pitches (Don't pitch Club Wyndham when a guest is simply asking for directions or entertainment advice). Kona is a fantastic place. The waters are simply astonishing regarding warmth and clarity. We would return to Kona in a heartbeat. Prior to staying at Wyndham Kona again, I would expect some significant upgrades to the resort.

Aloha, Great to hear that you enjoyed our spacious 2 -bedroom accomadations and other amenities and facilities offered. Thank you for this feedback for Kona Hawaiian. This will allow us to continue to enhance the vacation experience at our resort and to know other opportunities to improve to make your stay better in the future. Mahalo.

Nice in all respects. Across the street from the coast. 15 minute walk from downtown (aka no need to drive after some umbrella drinks...). Very nice, condo-style units -- spacious with kitchen and family room. Nice pools. Clean/well-maintained. Only negative is that they try to sell you more timeshare points and excursions pretty hard -- think this is normal for timeshare places. The excursions are through Expedia and are high quality,

Aloha, Great to hear abour your experience staying at Kona Hawaiian resort. I thank you for your comments, and we'll share it with all staff. We look forward for your vacation. Mahalo.

Stayed here in June 2014 with our family of 6, including twenty-somethings. Had a unit up the hill where it was really quiet and everyone enjoyed the sleep! Resort is handy to everything. Great kitchen for all of the chefs to work around one another! Rooms were clean and the washer/dryer was essential for washing and drying beach towels after the beach trips! key factor: the resort keeps a hut full of beach paraphernalia - no need to go to Costco or Walmart for chairs or umbrellas! Resort pool (upper) clean and gorgeous views. It would have been really nice to be able to order a cocktail, but there is no tiki bar and anyway that was not essential. We loved the big island and encourage others to stay here and take advantage of the location - near Kona and able to walk to shop or dinners, easy drive to any beach on the west side of the island, easy to get to the "cloud forest" for coffee tour, and easy to drive to Mauna Kea and Hilo. Highly recommend the helicopter tour of the island. Beautiful. Room Tip: Upstairs units on the hill are quieter and have a view of the ocean. See more room tips

Aloha, Thank you for the great feedback for Kona Hawaiian. Great to hear that all family members enjoyed Hawaiian vacation including the resort accommodation. We look forward to your next visit. Mahalo.

Location was perfect for quiet and peaceful vacation. Close to amenities - just a short walk away or jump in the car for snorkeling. Really appreciated the staff here...Reasonably priced in comparison to several hotels without kitchens in the units.

Aloha, Thank you very much for sharing your wonderful experience at the resort. we are glad that you and your family had enjoy the Island adventure. Mahalo,

Recently stayed here for 7 nights and overall we're very pleased. After looking at photos online and reviews I was skeptical about choosing this resort. Upon arrival and check in, the unit and resort exceeded my expectations. Large unit with updated furniture and well stocked kitchenware...non stick pan was super. Two minor complaints... the only dining table was outside and there were lots of flies, insects. Possible screening in would help. Also, pools were small and kids were bored. That said, we didn't spend a whole lot of time in unit or at pools. Would return again. Room Tip: Second floor to void noise. See more room tips

Aloha, Thank you kindly for all the wonderful words that you shared to us it's greatly appreciated. The resort is close to the beach and all the restaurant is only a minutes away. As for the units they've been renovated 5 years ago with new carpets and furnitures. Mahalo,

We booked this resort through a Hawaiian Airlines package deal. I thought that the price was incredible for the room quality. Our family of six attended (three adults/three kids) and we had a two bedroom/two bath condo. We arrived at the hotel pretty early in the morning (around 8:30am). We were told that check-in wasn't until 4pm and no rooms were currently available, however, the lady wrote down my cell phone number and said that she would call as soon as a room became available. The lady offered to store our luggage for us, too. It was around noon that I got a call from the front desk, stating that our room was ready. I thought that the space of the unit was perfect, and the layout was also great. The six of us slept comfortably in the room. I've read some reviews that state the internet isn't the greatest. I can vouch for that. The internet isn't the greatest, but I didn't mind. It was actually nice to break away from technology for a few days and enjoy our vacation. The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that we weren't told (upon check-in), that our room wouldn't be serviced while we were there. I found out on our third day (by reading the information book in the room), that the rooms were only serviced mid-week. If you want clean towels you have to wash them yourself with the laundry detergent provided in the room. I guess if you want more shampoo/conditioner, you need to go to the front desk and request that. I didn't mind washing our towels, but it would have been helpful if I had known upon check-in that our room wasn't going to be serviced. I would definitely stay there again.

Aloha, We greatly appreciate all the wonderful comments that you gave us during your stay in Kona hawaiian resort. We apologize about the internet connection that occur during your stay. Mahalo,

This is a very nice Kona Resort. The units are spacious and out room was immaculate upon checking in. Found it to be very quiet also, which I don't think I've ever experienced before in a "timeshare resort". The timeshare presentation was typical of most. Not a whole lot of pressure and the presenters were polite. My one and only complaint about the resort had to do with their wi-fi. It is absolutely horrible, AT&T is the provider and they just guaranteed me not switching to them because of the shoddy experience I had with it here at the resort. And they can't blame it on being in Kona. I stayed one night at the Royal Kona while here and the wifi was excellent... So Wyndham, please get your act together on this. As it stands now, I won't be coming back because I need access to the internet and I don't like having to find some place else in town to enjoy it. Plus when using my smartphone it kept exiting the wifi connection due to "slow connection times" so unbeknownst to me when I thought I was using my wifi on my phone, it was actually pulling from my data usage. Luckily, I caught it and turned off my phone. In the 4 days I've spent here so far, it had managed to eat up 75% of my data plan, because the wifi was exited. Oh and one other thing.. when I went to use the dryer, there were some articles of clothing from the previous guest still in there along with a bandaid! Apparently the service staff doesn't check the washer and dryers.. so be prepared... Also no direct beach access, so be prepared to drive if you want to get to the beach.

Thank you for this great feedback. This will allow us to continue to enhance the vacation experience at our resort. Mahalo.

Recently stayed here, 8/1-8/8. We found the unit to be quite comfortable. I told the Activities desk that we were not interested in the timeshare presentation and it was never brought up again. The only issue I had was that with Iselle approaching the island of Hawaii, we had to initiate contact with the staff regarding their emergency plan for guests. We would definitely stay here again.

Aloha, Thank you for your review for Kona Hawaiian resort. And we look forward for you next visit. Mahalo

Wyndham Kona Coast location is next door to- the Ocean so if you want Ocean front you are going to have to walk across the street! Excellent room size ( all rooms are 2 bedrooms/2 bath) plus a giant size kitchen with all the bells and whistles! The resorts grounds are kept perfect by happy worker bees that clean up every am! This is a great resort for a family and if you like to walk to the town of kona is only about 18 minutes! The resorts has several Gas Grills if you want to cook outside! We did not attempt to attend any activities at the resort because we had activities to attend off site! Lots of restaurants to eat at but i would highly recommend The Lava-Java for breakfast! The cinnamon bun is to die for!!! The pools are nice and clean but a little small but you are going to the Ocean anyway Right!!!! If you need anything the resort will attempt to help you with Good Choices for where to go for what you are wanting to accomplish ! The internet is ok in the am but spotty after 4:00 when everyone starts coming back from Hilo or other sights on the Big Island! The timeshare pitch (we were staying 2 weeks) so i missed it or wife must of made them aware that we were on VACATION! Remember to enjoy the sights and get a Car Rental ! You DO NOT need a 4 wheel drive to enjoy 98% of the Big Island! The Wyndham Kona Coast is a MUST STAY if you are going to Kona! The family cannot wait till we can return to the Big Island and i am proud to say " i would stay here again" and would recommend this Resort to family and friends without hesitation ! P.S. Get out there and enjoy the Big Island !!!!!!!! Room Tip: Ask to be placed up the hill as far as possible! If not, you will be looking at a White tent! See more room tips Green Features: You are in Hawaii so Everyone is into the environment! If you go to Costco or WalMart you will need to bring bags or buy a bag for .30 cents!

Aloha, I thank you for the wonderful review for Kona Hawaiian resort. And thank you for sharing great travel tips for everyone planning their Hawaiian vacation. Mahalo.

Excellent room size (2 bedroom/2 bath), nice beds, lanai, well-supplied condominium, air-conditioning, and 2 televisions. Overall, very nice accommodations. The grounds provide for a Hawaiian garden experience. It is a beautiful resort. Areas for improvement would include larger-sized pools (2), Internet service (Internet was slow to non-existent at times, weekly activities (redundant and of low quality), fitness facility (small and dated), poolside bar (it was not functioning during our stay), and timeshare sales pitches (Don't pitch Club Wyndham when a guest is simply asking for directions or entertainment advice). Kona is a fantastic place. The waters are simply astonishing regarding warmth and clarity. We would return to Kona in a heartbeat. Prior to staying at Wyndham Kona again, I would expect some significant upgrades to the resort.

Aloha, Great to hear that you enjoyed our spacious 2 -bedroom accomadations and other amenities and facilities offered. Thank you for this feedback for Kona Hawaiian. This will allow us to continue to enhance the vacation experience at our resort and to know other opportunities to improve to make your stay better in the future. Mahalo.

Nice in all respects. Across the street from the coast. 15 minute walk from downtown (aka no need to drive after some umbrella drinks...). Very nice, condo-style units -- spacious with kitchen and family room. Nice pools. Clean/well-maintained. Only negative is that they try to sell you more timeshare points and excursions pretty hard -- think this is normal for timeshare places. The excursions are through Expedia and are high quality,

Aloha, Great to hear abour your experience staying at Kona Hawaiian resort. I thank you for your comments, and we'll share it with all staff. We look forward for your vacation. Mahalo.

Stayed here in June 2014 with our family of 6, including twenty-somethings. Had a unit up the hill where it was really quiet and everyone enjoyed the sleep! Resort is handy to everything. Great kitchen for all of the chefs to work around one another! Rooms were clean and the washer/dryer was essential for washing and drying beach towels after the beach trips! key factor: the resort keeps a hut full of beach paraphernalia - no need to go to Costco or Walmart for chairs or umbrellas! Resort pool (upper) clean and gorgeous views. It would have been really nice to be able to order a cocktail, but there is no tiki bar and anyway that was not essential. We loved the big island and encourage others to stay here and take advantage of the location - near Kona and able to walk to shop or dinners, easy drive to any beach on the west side of the island, easy to get to the "cloud forest" for coffee tour, and easy to drive to Mauna Kea and Hilo. Highly recommend the helicopter tour of the island. Beautiful. Room Tip: Upstairs units on the hill are quieter and have a view of the ocean. See more room tips

Aloha, Thank you for the great feedback for Kona Hawaiian. Great to hear that all family members enjoyed Hawaiian vacation including the resort accommodation. We look forward to your next visit. Mahalo.

Location was perfect for quiet and peaceful vacation. Close to amenities - just a short walk away or jump in the car for snorkeling. Really appreciated the staff here...Reasonably priced in comparison to several hotels without kitchens in the units.

Aloha, Thank you very much for sharing your wonderful experience at the resort. we are glad that you and your family had enjoy the Island adventure. Mahalo,

Recently stayed here for 7 nights and overall we're very pleased. After looking at photos online and reviews I was skeptical about choosing this resort. Upon arrival and check in, the unit and resort exceeded my expectations. Large unit with updated furniture and well stocked kitchenware...non stick pan was super. Two minor complaints... the only dining table was outside and there were lots of flies, insects. Possible screening in would help. Also, pools were small and kids were bored. That said, we didn't spend a whole lot of time in unit or at pools. Would return again. Room Tip: Second floor to void noise. See more room tips

Aloha, It's was a pleasure to have you as our guest here in the resort, thank you very much for all the wonderful words that you experience with us. We are glad that we meet your expectation to our resort. We love to see you here again. Mahalo

Stayed here July 2014. Units have nice layout but the furniture is old and uncomfortable. The carpet is old and I wonder why in a place near sandy beaches it isn't tiled anyway. The spa tub in the master bedroom is one of those like in the dial is commercials... Only one person can get in at a time... The grounds were pretty. The staff were friendly. Pools were small but ok.

I thought that the space of the unit was perfect, and the layout was also great. The six of us slept comfortably in the room. I've read some reviews that state the internet isn't the greatest. I can vouch for that. The internet isn't the greatest, but I didn't mind. It was actually nice to break away from technology for a few days and enjoy our vacation. The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that we weren't told (upon check-in), that our room wouldn't be serviced while we were there. I found out on our third day (by reading the information book in the room), that the rooms were only serviced mid-week. If you want clean towels you have to wash them yourself with the laundry detergent provided in the room. I guess if you want more shampoo/conditioner, you need to go to the front desk and request that. I didn't mind washing our towels, but it would have been helpful if I had known upon check-in that our room wasn't going to be serviced. I would definitely stay there again.

Aloha, We greatly appreciate all the wonderful comments that you gave us during your stay in Kona hawaiian resort. We apologize about the internet connection that occur during your stay. Mahalo,

This is a very nice Kona Resort. The units are spacious and out room was immaculate upon checking in. Found it to be very quiet also, which I don't think I've ever experienced before in a "timeshare resort". The timeshare presentation was typical of most. Not a whole lot of pressure and the presenters were polite. My one and only complaint about the resort had to do with their wi-fi. It is absolutely horrible, AT&T is the provider and they just guaranteed me not switching to them because of the shoddy experience I had with it here at the resort. And they can't blame it on being in Kona. I stayed one night at the Royal Kona while here and the wifi was excellent... So Wyndham, please get your act together on this. As it stands now, I won't be coming back because I need access to the internet and I don't like having to find some place else in town to enjoy it. Plus when using my smartphone it kept exiting the wifi connection due to "slow connection times" so unbeknownst to me when I thought I was using my wifi on my phone, it was actually pulling from my data usage. Luckily, I caught it and turned off my phone. In the 4 days I've spent here so far, it had managed to eat up 75% of my data plan, because the wifi was exited. Oh and one other thing.. when I went to use the dryer, there were some articles of clothing from the previous guest still in there along with a bandaid! Apparently the service staff doesn't check the washer and dryers.. so be prepared... Also no direct beach access, so be prepared to drive if you want to get to the beach.

Thank you for this great feedback. This will allow us to continue to enhance the vacation experience at our resort. Mahalo.

Recently stayed here, 8/1-8/8. We found the unit to be quite comfortable. I told the Activities desk that we were not interested in the timeshare presentation and it was never brought up again. The only issue I had was that with Iselle approaching the island of Hawaii, we had to initiate contact with the staff regarding their emergency plan for guests. We would definitely stay here again.

Aloha, Thank you for your review for Kona Hawaiian resort. And we look forward for you next visit. Mahalo

Wyndham Kona Coast location is next door to- the Ocean so if you want Ocean front you are going to have to walk across the street! Excellent room size ( all rooms are 2 bedrooms/2 bath) plus a giant size kitchen with all the bells and whistles! The resorts grounds are kept perfect by happy worker bees that clean up every am! This is a great resort for a family and if you like to walk to the town of kona is only about 18 minutes! The resorts has several Gas Grills if you want to cook outside! We did not attempt to attend any activities at the resort because we had activities to attend off site! Lots of restaurants to eat at but i would highly recommend The Lava-Java for breakfast! The cinnamon bun is to die for!!! The pools are nice and clean but a little small but you are going to the Ocean anyway Right!!!! If you need anything the resort will attempt to help you with Good Choices for where to go for what you are wanting to accomplish ! The internet is ok in the am but spotty after 4:00 when everyone starts coming back from Hilo or other sights on the Big Island! The timeshare pitch (we were staying 2 weeks) so i missed it or wife must of made them aware that we were on VACATION! Remember to enjoy the sights and get a Car Rental ! You DO NOT need a 4 wheel drive to enjoy 98% of the Big Island! The Wyndham Kona Coast is a MUST STAY if you are going to Kona! The family cannot wait till we can return to the Big Island and i am proud to say " i would stay here again" and would recommend this Resort to family and friends without hesitation ! P.S. Get out there and enjoy the Big Island !!!!!!!! Room Tip: Ask to be placed up the hill as far as possible! If not, you will be looking at a White tent! See more room tips Green Features: You are in Hawaii so Everyone is into the environment! If you go to Costco or WalMart you will need to bring bags or buy a bag for .30 cents!

Aloha, I thank you for the wonderful review for Kona Hawaiian resort. And thank you for sharing great travel tips for everyone planning their Hawaiian vacation. Mahalo.

Excellent room size (2 bedroom/2 bath), nice beds, lanai, well-supplied condominium, air-conditioning, and 2 televisions. Overall, very nice accommodations. The grounds provide for a Hawaiian garden experience. It is a beautiful resort. Areas for improvement would include larger-sized pools (2), Internet service (Internet was slow to non-existent at times, weekly activities (redundant and of low quality), fitness facility (small and dated), poolside bar (it was not functioning during our stay), and timeshare sales pitches (Don't pitch Club Wyndham when a guest is simply asking for directions or entertainment advice). Kona is a fantastic place. The waters are simply astonishing regarding warmth and clarity. We would return to Kona in a heartbeat. Prior to staying at Wyndham Kona again, I would expect some significant upgrades to the resort.

Aloha, Great to hear that you enjoyed our spacious 2 -bedroom accomadations and other amenities and facilities offered. Thank you for this feedback for Kona Hawaiian. This will allow us to continue to enhance the vacation experience at our resort and to know other opportunities to improve to make your stay better in the future. Mahalo.

Nice in all respects. Across the street from the coast. 15 minute walk from downtown (aka no need to drive after some umbrella drinks...). Very nice, condo-style units -- spacious with kitchen and family room. Nice pools. Clean/well-maintained. Only negative is that they try to sell you more timeshare points and excursions pretty hard -- think this is normal for timeshare places. The excursions are through Expedia and are high quality,

Aloha, Great to hear abour your experience staying at Kona Hawaiian resort. I thank you for your comments, and we'll share it with all staff. We look forward for your vacation. Mahalo.

Stayed here in June 2014 with our family of 6, including twenty-somethings. Had a unit up the hill where it was really quiet and everyone enjoyed the sleep! Resort is handy to everything. Great kitchen for all of the chefs to work around one another! Rooms were clean and the washer/dryer was essential for washing and drying beach towels after the beach trips! key factor: the resort keeps a hut full of beach paraphernalia - no need to go to Costco or Walmart for chairs or umbrellas! Resort pool (upper) clean and gorgeous views. It would have been really nice to be able to order a cocktail, but there is no tiki bar and anyway that was not essential. We loved the big island and encourage others to stay here and take advantage of the location - near Kona and able to walk to shop or dinners, easy drive to any beach on the west side of the island, easy to get to the "cloud forest" for coffee tour, and easy to drive to Mauna Kea and Hilo. Highly recommend the helicopter tour of the island. Beautiful. Room Tip: Upstairs units on the hill are quieter and have a view of the ocean. See more room tips

Aloha, Thank you for the great feedback for Kona Hawaiian. Great to hear that all family members enjoyed Hawaiian vacation including the resort accommodation. We look forward to your next visit. Mahalo.

Location was perfect for quiet and peaceful vacation. Close to amenities - just a short walk away or jump in the car for snorkeling. Really appreciated the staff here...Reasonably priced in comparison to several hotels without kitchens in the units.

Aloha, Thank you very much for sharing your wonderful experience at the resort. we are glad that you and your family had enjoy the Island adventure. Mahalo,

Recently stayed here for 7 nights and overall we're very pleased. After looking at photos online and reviews I was skeptical about choosing this resort. Upon arrival and check in, the unit and resort exceeded my expectations. Large unit with updated furniture and well stocked kitchenware...non stick pan was super. Two minor complaints... the only dining table was outside and there were lots of flies, insects. Possible screening in would help. Also, pools were small and kids were bored. That said, we didn't spend a whole lot of time in unit or at pools. Would return again. Room Tip: Second floor to void noise. See more room tips

Aloha, It's was a pleasure to have you as our guest here in the resort, thank you very much for all the wonderful words that you experience with us. We are glad that we meet your expectation to our resort. We love to see you here again. Mahalo

Stayed here July 2014. Units have nice layout but the furniture is old and uncomfortable. The carpet is old and I wonder why in a place near sandy beaches it isn't tiled anyway. The spa tub in the master bedroom is one of those like in the dial is commercials... Only one person can get in at a time... The grounds were pretty. The staff were friendly. Pools were small but ok. Location is not on the beach and across the street the beach is rocky so you have to drive to sandy beach area. Otherwise location is short drive distance to grocery and restaurants nearby. Room Tip: Blogs are two stories with stair access to upper units. If stairs are a challenge ask for lower lev... See more room tips

Aloha, Thank you kindly for all the wonderful words that you shared to us it's greatly appreciated. The resort is close to the beach and all the restaurant is only a minutes away. As for the units they've been renovated 5 years ago with new carpets and furnitures. Mahalo,

We booked this resort through a Hawaiian Airlines package deal. I thought that the price was incredible for the room quality. Our family of six attended (three adults/three kids) and we had a two bedroom/two bath condo. We arrived at the hotel pretty early in the morning (around 8:30am). We were told that check-in wasn't until 4pm and no rooms were currently available, however, the lady wrote down my cell phone number and said that she would call as soon as a room became available.

I didn't mind washing our towels, but it would have been helpful if I had known upon check-in that our room wasn't going to be serviced. I would definitely stay there again.

Aloha, We greatly appreciate all the wonderful comments that you gave us during your stay in Kona hawaiian resort. We apologize about the internet connection that occur during your stay. Mahalo,

This is a very nice Kona Resort. The units are spacious and out room was immaculate upon checking in. Found it to be very quiet also, which I don't think I've ever experienced before in a "timeshare resort". The timeshare presentation was typical of most. Not a whole lot of pressure and the presenters were polite. My one and only complaint about the resort had to do with their wi-fi. It is absolutely horrible, AT&T is the provider and they just guaranteed me not switching to them because of the shoddy experience I had with it here at the resort. And they can't blame it on being in Kona. I stayed one night at the Royal Kona while here and the wifi was excellent... So Wyndham, please get your act together on this. As it stands now, I won't be coming back because I need access to the internet and I don't like having to find some place else in town to enjoy it. Plus when using my smartphone it kept exiting the wifi connection due to "slow connection times" so unbeknownst to me when I thought I was using my wifi on my phone, it was actually pulling from my data usage. Luckily, I caught it and turned off my phone. In the 4 days I've spent here so far, it had managed to eat up 75% of my data plan, because the wifi was exited. Oh and one other thing.. when I went to use the dryer, there were some articles of clothing from the previous guest still in there along with a bandaid! Apparently the service staff doesn't check the washer and dryers.. so be prepared... Also no direct beach access, so be prepared to drive if you want to get to the beach.

Thank you for this great feedback. This will allow us to continue to enhance the vacation experience at our resort. Mahalo.

Recently stayed here, 8/1-8/8. We found the unit to be quite comfortable. I told the Activities desk that we were not interested in the timeshare presentation and it was never brought up again. The only issue I had was that with Iselle approaching the island of Hawaii, we had to initiate contact with the staff regarding their emergency plan for guests. We would definitely stay here again.

Aloha, Thank you for your review for Kona Hawaiian resort. And we look forward for you next visit. Mahalo

Wyndham Kona Coast location is next door to- the Ocean so if you want Ocean front you are going to have to walk across the street! Excellent room size ( all rooms are 2 bedrooms/2 bath) plus a giant size kitchen with all the bells and whistles! The resorts grounds are kept perfect by happy worker bees that clean up every am! This is a great resort for a family and if you like to walk to the town of kona is only about 18 minutes! The resorts has several Gas Grills if you want to cook outside! We did not attempt to attend any activities at the resort because we had activities to attend off site! Lots of restaurants to eat at but i would highly recommend The Lava-Java for breakfast! The cinnamon bun is to die for!!! The pools are nice and clean but a little small but you are going to the Ocean anyway Right!!!! If you need anything the resort will attempt to help you with Good Choices for where to go for what you are wanting to accomplish ! The internet is ok in the am but spotty after 4:00 when everyone starts coming back from Hilo or other sights on the Big Island! The timeshare pitch (we were staying 2 weeks) so i missed it or wife must of made them aware that we were on VACATION! Remember to enjoy the sights and get a Car Rental ! You DO NOT need a 4 wheel drive to enjoy 98% of the Big Island! The Wyndham Kona Coast is a MUST STAY if you are going to Kona! The family cannot wait till we can return to the Big Island and i am proud to say " i would stay here again" and would recommend this Resort to family and friends without hesitation ! P.S. Get out there and enjoy the Big Island !!!!!!!! Room Tip: Ask to be placed up the hill as far as possible! If not, you will be looking at a White tent! See more room tips Green Features: You are in Hawaii so Everyone is into the environment! If you go to Costco or WalMart you will need to bring bags or buy a bag for .30 cents!

Aloha, I thank you for the wonderful review for Kona Hawaiian resort. And thank you for sharing great travel tips for everyone planning their Hawaiian vacation. Mahalo.

Excellent room size (2 bedroom/2 bath), nice beds, lanai, well-supplied condominium, air-conditioning, and 2 televisions. Overall, very nice accommodations. The grounds provide for a Hawaiian garden experience. It is a beautiful resort. Areas for improvement would include larger-sized pools (2), Internet service (Internet was slow to non-existent at times, weekly activities (redundant and of low quality), fitness facility (small and dated), poolside bar (it was not functioning during our stay), and timeshare sales pitches (Don't pitch Club Wyndham when a guest is simply asking for directions or entertainment advice). Kona is a fantastic place. The waters are simply astonishing regarding warmth and clarity. We would return to Kona in a heartbeat. Prior to staying at Wyndham Kona again, I would expect some significant upgrades to the resort.

Aloha, Great to hear that you enjoyed our spacious 2 -bedroom accomadations and other amenities and facilities offered. Thank you for this feedback for Kona Hawaiian. This will allow us to continue to enhance the vacation experience at our resort and to know other opportunities to improve to make your stay better in the future. Mahalo.

Nice in all respects. Across the street from the coast. 15 minute walk from downtown (aka no need to drive after some umbrella drinks...). Very nice, condo-style units -- spacious with kitchen and family room. Nice pools. Clean/well-maintained. Only negative is that they try to sell you more timeshare points and excursions pretty hard -- think this is normal for timeshare places. The excursions are through Expedia and are high quality,

Aloha, Great to hear abour your experience staying at Kona Hawaiian resort. I thank you for your comments, and we'll share it with all staff. We look forward for your vacation. Mahalo.

Stayed here in June 2014 with our family of 6, including twenty-somethings. Had a unit up the hill where it was really quiet and everyone enjoyed the sleep! Resort is handy to everything. Great kitchen for all of the chefs to work around one another! Rooms were clean and the washer/dryer was essential for washing and drying beach towels after the beach trips! key factor: the resort keeps a hut full of beach paraphernalia - no need to go to Costco or Walmart for chairs or umbrellas! Resort pool (upper) clean and gorgeous views. It would have been really nice to be able to order a cocktail, but there is no tiki bar and anyway that was not essential. We loved the big island and encourage others to stay here and take advantage of the location - near Kona and able to walk to shop or dinners, easy drive to any beach on the west side of the island, easy to get to the "cloud forest" for coffee tour, and easy to drive to Mauna Kea and Hilo. Highly recommend the helicopter tour of the island. Beautiful. Room Tip: Upstairs units on the hill are quieter and have a view of the ocean. See more room tips

Aloha, Thank you for the great feedback for Kona Hawaiian. Great to hear that all family members enjoyed Hawaiian vacation including the resort accommodation. We look forward to your next visit. Mahalo.

Location was perfect for quiet and peaceful vacation. Close to amenities - just a short walk away or jump in the car for snorkeling. Really appreciated the staff here...Reasonably priced in comparison to several hotels without kitchens in the units.

Aloha, Thank you very much for sharing your wonderful experience at the resort. we are glad that you and your family had enjoy the Island adventure. Mahalo,

Recently stayed here for 7 nights and overall we're very pleased. After looking at photos online and reviews I was skeptical about choosing this resort. Upon arrival and check in, the unit and resort exceeded my expectations. Large unit with updated furniture and well stocked kitchenware...non stick pan was super. Two minor complaints... the only dining table was outside and there were lots of flies, insects. Possible screening in would help. Also, pools were small and kids were bored. That said, we didn't spend a whole lot of time in unit or at pools. Would return again. Room Tip: Second floor to void noise. See more room tips

Aloha, It's was a pleasure to have you as our guest here in the resort, thank you very much for all the wonderful words that you experience with us. We are glad that we meet your expectation to our resort. We love to see you here again. Mahalo

Stayed here July 2014. Units have nice layout but the furniture is old and uncomfortable. The carpet is old and I wonder why in a place near sandy beaches it isn't tiled anyway. The spa tub in the master bedroom is one of those like in the dial is commercials... Only one person can get in at a time... The grounds were pretty. The staff were friendly. Pools were small but ok. Location is not on the beach and across the street the beach is rocky so you have to drive to sandy beach area. Otherwise location is short drive distance to grocery and restaurants nearby. Room Tip: Blogs are two stories with stair access to upper units. If stairs are a challenge ask for lower lev... See more room tips

Aloha, Thank you kindly for all the wonderful words that you shared to us it's greatly appreciated. The resort is close to the beach and all the restaurant is only a minutes away. As for the units they've been renovated 5 years ago with new carpets and furnitures. Mahalo,

We booked this resort through a Hawaiian Airlines package deal. I thought that the price was incredible for the room quality. Our family of six attended (three adults/three kids) and we had a two bedroom/two bath condo. We arrived at the hotel pretty early in the morning (around 8:30am). We were told that check-in wasn't until 4pm and no rooms were currently available, however, the lady wrote down my cell phone number and said that she would call as soon as a room became available. The lady offered to store our luggage for us, too. It was around noon that I got a call from the front desk, stating that our room was ready. I thought that the space of the unit was perfect, and the layout was also great. The six of us slept comfortably in the room. I've read some reviews that state the internet isn't the greatest. I can vouch for that. The internet isn't the greatest, but I didn't mind. It was actually nice to break away from technology for a few days and enjoy our vacation. The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that we weren't told (upon check-in), that our room wouldn't be serviced while we were there. I found out on our third day (by reading the information book in the room), that the rooms were only serviced mid-week. If you want clean towels you have to wash them yourself with the laundry detergent provided in the room. I guess if you want more shampoo/conditioner, you need to go to the front desk and request that. I didn't mind washing our towels, but it would have been helpful if I had known upon check-in that our room wasn't going to be serviced. I would definitely stay there again.

As it stands now, I won't be coming back because I need access to the internet and I don't like having to find some place else in town to enjoy it. Plus when using my smartphone it kept exiting the wifi connection due to "slow connection times" so unbeknownst to me when I thought I was using my wifi on my phone, it was actually pulling from my data usage. Luckily, I caught it and turned off my phone. In the 4 days I've spent here so far, it had managed to eat up 75% of my data plan, because the wifi was exited. Oh and one other thing.. when I went to use the dryer, there were some articles of clothing from the previous guest still in there along with a bandaid! Apparently the service staff doesn't check the washer and dryers.. so be prepared... Also no direct beach access, so be prepared to drive if you want to get to the beach.

Thank you for this great feedback. This will allow us to continue to enhance the vacation experience at our resort. Mahalo.

Recently stayed here, 8/1-8/8. We found the unit to be quite comfortable. I told the Activities desk that we were not interested in the timeshare presentation and it was never brought up again. The only issue I had was that with Iselle approaching the island of Hawaii, we had to initiate contact with the staff regarding their emergency plan for guests. We would definitely stay here again.

Aloha, Thank you for your review for Kona Hawaiian resort. And we look forward for you next visit. Mahalo

Wyndham Kona Coast location is next door to- the Ocean so if you want Ocean front you are going to have to walk across the street! Excellent room size ( all rooms are 2 bedrooms/2 bath) plus a giant size kitchen with all the bells and whistles! The resorts grounds are kept perfect by happy worker bees that clean up every am! This is a great resort for a family and if you like to walk to the town of kona is only about 18 minutes! The resorts has several Gas Grills if you want to cook outside! We did not attempt to attend any activities at the resort because we had activities to attend off site! Lots of restaurants to eat at but i would highly recommend The Lava-Java for breakfast! The cinnamon bun is to die for!!! The pools are nice and clean but a little small but you are going to the Ocean anyway Right!!!! If you need anything the resort will attempt to help you with Good Choices for where to go for what you are wanting to accomplish ! The internet is ok in the am but spotty after 4:00 when everyone starts coming back from Hilo or other sights on the Big Island! The timeshare pitch (we were staying 2 weeks) so i missed it or wife must of made them aware that we were on VACATION! Remember to enjoy the sights and get a Car Rental ! You DO NOT need a 4 wheel drive to enjoy 98% of the Big Island! The Wyndham Kona Coast is a MUST STAY if you are going to Kona! The family cannot wait till we can return to the Big Island and i am proud to say " i would stay here again" and would recommend this Resort to family and friends without hesitation ! P.S. Get out there and enjoy the Big Island !!!!!!!! Room Tip: Ask to be placed up the hill as far as possible! If not, you will be looking at a White tent! See more room tips Green Features: You are in Hawaii so Everyone is into the environment! If you go to Costco or WalMart you will need to bring bags or buy a bag for .30 cents!

Aloha, I thank you for the wonderful review for Kona Hawaiian resort. And thank you for sharing great travel tips for everyone planning their Hawaiian vacation. Mahalo.

Excellent room size (2 bedroom/2 bath), nice beds, lanai, well-supplied condominium, air-conditioning, and 2 televisions. Overall, very nice accommodations. The grounds provide for a Hawaiian garden experience. It is a beautiful resort. Areas for improvement would include larger-sized pools (2), Internet service (Internet was slow to non-existent at times, weekly activities (redundant and of low quality), fitness facility (small and dated), poolside bar (it was not functioning during our stay), and timeshare sales pitches (Don't pitch Club Wyndham when a guest is simply asking for directions or entertainment advice). Kona is a fantastic place. The waters are simply astonishing regarding warmth and clarity. We would return to Kona in a heartbeat. Prior to staying at Wyndham Kona again, I would expect some significant upgrades to the resort.

Aloha, Great to hear that you enjoyed our spacious 2 -bedroom accomadations and other amenities and facilities offered. Thank you for this feedback for Kona Hawaiian. This will allow us to continue to enhance the vacation experience at our resort and to know other opportunities to improve to make your stay better in the future. Mahalo.

Nice in all respects. Across the street from the coast. 15 minute walk from downtown (aka no need to drive after some umbrella drinks...). Very nice, condo-style units -- spacious with kitchen and family room. Nice pools. Clean/well-maintained. Only negative is that they try to sell you more timeshare points and excursions pretty hard -- think this is normal for timeshare places. The excursions are through Expedia and are high quality,

Aloha, Great to hear abour your experience staying at Kona Hawaiian resort. I thank you for your comments, and we'll share it with all staff. We look forward for your vacation. Mahalo.

Stayed here in June 2014 with our family of 6, including twenty-somethings. Had a unit up the hill where it was really quiet and everyone enjoyed the sleep! Resort is handy to everything. Great kitchen for all of the chefs to work around one another! Rooms were clean and the washer/dryer was essential for washing and drying beach towels after the beach trips! key factor: the resort keeps a hut full of beach paraphernalia - no need to go to Costco or Walmart for chairs or umbrellas! Resort pool (upper) clean and gorgeous views. It would have been really nice to be able to order a cocktail, but there is no tiki bar and anyway that was not essential. We loved the big island and encourage others to stay here and take advantage of the location - near Kona and able to walk to shop or dinners, easy drive to any beach on the west side of the island, easy to get to the "cloud forest" for coffee tour, and easy to drive to Mauna Kea and Hilo. Highly recommend the helicopter tour of the island. Beautiful. Room Tip: Upstairs units on the hill are quieter and have a view of the ocean. See more room tips

Aloha, Thank you for the great feedback for Kona Hawaiian. Great to hear that all family members enjoyed Hawaiian vacation including the resort accommodation. We look forward to your next visit. Mahalo.

Location was perfect for quiet and peaceful vacation. Close to amenities - just a short walk away or jump in the car for snorkeling. Really appreciated the staff here...Reasonably priced in comparison to several hotels without kitchens in the units.

Aloha, Thank you very much for sharing your wonderful experience at the resort. we are glad that you and your family had enjoy the Island adventure. Mahalo,

Recently stayed here for 7 nights and overall we're very pleased. After looking at photos online and reviews I was skeptical about choosing this resort. Upon arrival and check in, the unit and resort exceeded my expectations. Large unit with updated furniture and well stocked kitchenware...non stick pan was super. Two minor complaints... the only dining table was outside and there were lots of flies, insects. Possible screening in would help. Also, pools were small and kids were bored. That said, we didn't spend a whole lot of time in unit or at pools. Would return again. Room Tip: Second floor to void noise. See more room tips

Aloha, It's was a pleasure to have you as our guest here in the resort, thank you very much for all the wonderful words that you experience with us. We are glad that we meet your expectation to our resort. We love to see you here again. Mahalo

Stayed here July 2014. Units have nice layout but the furniture is old and uncomfortable. The carpet is old and I wonder why in a place near sandy beaches it isn't tiled anyway. The spa tub in the master bedroom is one of those like in the dial is commercials... Only one person can get in at a time... The grounds were pretty. The staff were friendly. Pools were small but ok. Location is not on the beach and across the street the beach is rocky so you have to drive to sandy beach area. Otherwise location is short drive distance to grocery and restaurants nearby. Room Tip: Blogs are two stories with stair access to upper units. If stairs are a challenge ask for lower lev... See more room tips

Aloha, Thank you kindly for all the wonderful words that you shared to us it's greatly appreciated. The resort is close to the beach and all the restaurant is only a minutes away. As for the units they've been renovated 5 years ago with new carpets and furnitures. Mahalo,

We booked this resort through a Hawaiian Airlines package deal. I thought that the price was incredible for the room quality. Our family of six attended (three adults/three kids) and we had a two bedroom/two bath condo. We arrived at the hotel pretty early in the morning (around 8:30am). We were told that check-in wasn't until 4pm and no rooms were currently available, however, the lady wrote down my cell phone number and said that she would call as soon as a room became available. The lady offered to store our luggage for us, too. It was around noon that I got a call from the front desk, stating that our room was ready. I thought that the space of the unit was perfect, and the layout was also great. The six of us slept comfortably in the room. I've read some reviews that state the internet isn't the greatest. I can vouch for that. The internet isn't the greatest, but I didn't mind. It was actually nice to break away from technology for a few days and enjoy our vacation. The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that we weren't told (upon check-in), that our room wouldn't be serviced while we were there. I found out on our third day (by reading the information book in the room), that the rooms were only serviced mid-week. If you want clean towels you have to wash them yourself with the laundry detergent provided in the room. I guess if you want more shampoo/conditioner, you need to go to the front desk and request that. I didn't mind washing our towels, but it would have been helpful if I had known upon check-in that our room wasn't going to be serviced. I would definitely stay there again.

Aloha, We greatly appreciate all the wonderful comments that you gave us during your stay in Kona hawaiian resort. We apologize about the internet connection that occur during your stay. Mahalo,

This is a very nice Kona Resort. The units are spacious and out room was immaculate upon checking in. Found it to be very quiet also, which I don't think I've ever experienced before in a "timeshare resort". The timeshare presentation was typical of most. Not a whole lot of pressure and the presenters were polite. My one and only complaint about the resort had to do with their wi-fi. It is absolutely horrible, AT&T is the provider and they just guaranteed me not switching to them because of the shoddy experience I had with it here at the resort. And they can't blame it on being in Kona. I stayed one night at the Royal Kona while here and the wifi was excellent... So Wyndham, please get your act together on this.

Thank you for this great feedback. This will allow us to continue to enhance the vacation experience at our resort. Mahalo.

Recently stayed here, 8/1-8/8. We found the unit to be quite comfortable. I told the Activities desk that we were not interested in the timeshare presentation and it was never brought up again. The only issue I had was that with Iselle approaching the island of Hawaii, we had to initiate contact with the staff regarding their emergency plan for guests. We would definitely stay here again.

Aloha, Thank you for your review for Kona Hawaiian resort. And we look forward for you next visit. Mahalo

Wyndham Kona Coast location is next door to- the Ocean so if you want Ocean front you are going to have to walk across the street! Excellent room size ( all rooms are 2 bedrooms/2 bath) plus a giant size kitchen with all the bells and whistles! The resorts grounds are kept perfect by happy worker bees that clean up every am! This is a great resort for a family and if you like to walk to the town of kona is only about 18 minutes! The resorts has several Gas Grills if you want to cook outside! We did not attempt to attend any activities at the resort because we had activities to attend off site! Lots of restaurants to eat at but i would highly recommend The Lava-Java for breakfast! The cinnamon bun is to die for!!! The pools are nice and clean but a little small but you are going to the Ocean anyway Right!!!! If you need anything the resort will attempt to help you with Good Choices for where to go for what you are wanting to accomplish ! The internet is ok in the am but spotty after 4:00 when everyone starts coming back from Hilo or other sights on the Big Island! The timeshare pitch (we were staying 2 weeks) so i missed it or wife must of made them aware that we were on VACATION! Remember to enjoy the sights and get a Car Rental ! You DO NOT need a 4 wheel drive to enjoy 98% of the Big Island! The Wyndham Kona Coast is a MUST STAY if you are going to Kona! The family cannot wait till we can return to the Big Island and i am proud to say " i would stay here again" and would recommend this Resort to family and friends without hesitation ! P.S. Get out there and enjoy the Big Island !!!!!!!! Room Tip: Ask to be placed up the hill as far as possible! If not, you will be looking at a White tent! See more room tips Green Features: You are in Hawaii so Everyone is into the environment! If you go to Costco or WalMart you will need to bring bags or buy a bag for .30 cents!

Aloha, I thank you for the wonderful review for Kona Hawaiian resort. And thank you for sharing great travel tips for everyone planning their Hawaiian vacation. Mahalo.

Excellent room size (2 bedroom/2 bath), nice beds, lanai, well-supplied condominium, air-conditioning, and 2 televisions. Overall, very nice accommodations. The grounds provide for a Hawaiian garden experience. It is a beautiful resort. Areas for improvement would include larger-sized pools (2), Internet service (Internet was slow to non-existent at times, weekly activities (redundant and of low quality), fitness facility (small and dated), poolside bar (it was not functioning during our stay), and timeshare sales pitches (Don't pitch Club Wyndham when a guest is simply asking for directions or entertainment advice). Kona is a fantastic place. The waters are simply astonishing regarding warmth and clarity. We would return to Kona in a heartbeat. Prior to staying at Wyndham Kona again, I would expect some significant upgrades to the resort.

Aloha, Great to hear that you enjoyed our spacious 2 -bedroom accomadations and other amenities and facilities offered. Thank you for this feedback for Kona Hawaiian. This will allow us to continue to enhance the vacation experience at our resort and to know other opportunities to improve to make your stay better in the future. Mahalo.

Nice in all respects. Across the street from the coast. 15 minute walk from downtown (aka no need to drive after some umbrella drinks...). Very nice, condo-style units -- spacious with kitchen and family room. Nice pools. Clean/well-maintained. Only negative is that they try to sell you more timeshare points and excursions pretty hard -- think this is normal for timeshare places. The excursions are through Expedia and are high quality,

Aloha, Great to hear abour your experience staying at Kona Hawaiian resort. I thank you for your comments, and we'll share it with all staff. We look forward for your vacation. Mahalo.

Stayed here in June 2014 with our family of 6, including twenty-somethings. Had a unit up the hill where it was really quiet and everyone enjoyed the sleep! Resort is handy to everything. Great kitchen for all of the chefs to work around one another! Rooms were clean and the washer/dryer was essential for washing and drying beach towels after the beach trips! key factor: the resort keeps a hut full of beach paraphernalia - no need to go to Costco or Walmart for chairs or umbrellas! Resort pool (upper) clean and gorgeous views. It would have been really nice to be able to order a cocktail, but there is no tiki bar and anyway that was not essential. We loved the big island and encourage others to stay here and take advantage of the location - near Kona and able to walk to shop or dinners, easy drive to any beach on the west side of the island, easy to get to the "cloud forest" for coffee tour, and easy to drive to Mauna Kea and Hilo. Highly recommend the helicopter tour of the island. Beautiful. Room Tip: Upstairs units on the hill are quieter and have a view of the ocean. See more room tips

Aloha, Thank you for the great feedback for Kona Hawaiian. Great to hear that all family members enjoyed Hawaiian vacation including the resort accommodation. We look forward to your next visit. Mahalo.

Location was perfect for quiet and peaceful vacation. Close to amenities - just a short walk away or jump in the car for snorkeling. Really appreciated the staff here...Reasonably priced in comparison to several hotels without kitchens in the units.

Aloha, Thank you very much for sharing your wonderful experience at the resort. we are glad that you and your family had enjoy the Island adventure. Mahalo,

Recently stayed here for 7 nights and overall we're very pleased. After looking at photos online and reviews I was skeptical about choosing this resort. Upon arrival and check in, the unit and resort exceeded my expectations. Large unit with updated furniture and well stocked kitchenware...non stick pan was super. Two minor complaints... the only dining table was outside and there were lots of flies, insects. Possible screening in would help. Also, pools were small and kids were bored. That said, we didn't spend a whole lot of time in unit or at pools. Would return again. Room Tip: Second floor to void noise. See more room tips

Aloha, It's was a pleasure to have you as our guest here in the resort, thank you very much for all the wonderful words that you experience with us. We are glad that we meet your expectation to our resort. We love to see you here again. Mahalo

Stayed here July 2014. Units have nice layout but the furniture is old and uncomfortable. The carpet is old and I wonder why in a place near sandy beaches it isn't tiled anyway. The spa tub in the master bedroom is one of those like in the dial is commercials... Only one person can get in at a time... The grounds were pretty. The staff were friendly. Pools were small but ok. Location is not on the beach and across the street the beach is rocky so you have to drive to sandy beach area. Otherwise location is short drive distance to grocery and restaurants nearby. Room Tip: Blogs are two stories with stair access to upper units. If stairs are a challenge ask for lower lev... See more room tips

Aloha, Thank you kindly for all the wonderful words that you shared to us it's greatly appreciated. The resort is close to the beach and all the restaurant is only a minutes away. As for the units they've been renovated 5 years ago with new carpets and furnitures. Mahalo,

We booked this resort through a Hawaiian Airlines package deal. I thought that the price was incredible for the room quality. Our family of six attended (three adults/three kids) and we had a two bedroom/two bath condo. We arrived at the hotel pretty early in the morning (around 8:30am). We were told that check-in wasn't until 4pm and no rooms were currently available, however, the lady wrote down my cell phone number and said that she would call as soon as a room became available. The lady offered to store our luggage for us, too. It was around noon that I got a call from the front desk, stating that our room was ready. I thought that the space of the unit was perfect, and the layout was also great. The six of us slept comfortably in the room. I've read some reviews that state the internet isn't the greatest. I can vouch for that. The internet isn't the greatest, but I didn't mind. It was actually nice to break away from technology for a few days and enjoy our vacation. The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that we weren't told (upon check-in), that our room wouldn't be serviced while we were there. I found out on our third day (by reading the information book in the room), that the rooms were only serviced mid-week. If you want clean towels you have to wash them yourself with the laundry detergent provided in the room. I guess if you want more shampoo/conditioner, you need to go to the front desk and request that. I didn't mind washing our towels, but it would have been helpful if I had known upon check-in that our room wasn't going to be serviced. I would definitely stay there again.

Aloha, We greatly appreciate all the wonderful comments that you gave us during your stay in Kona hawaiian resort. We apologize about the internet connection that occur during your stay. Mahalo,

This is a very nice Kona Resort. The units are spacious and out room was immaculate upon checking in. Found it to be very quiet also, which I don't think I've ever experienced before in a "timeshare resort". The timeshare presentation was typical of most. Not a whole lot of pressure and the presenters were polite. My one and only complaint about the resort had to do with their wi-fi. It is absolutely horrible, AT&T is the provider and they just guaranteed me not switching to them because of the shoddy experience I had with it here at the resort. And they can't blame it on being in Kona. I stayed one night at the Royal Kona while here and the wifi was excellent... So Wyndham, please get your act together on this. As it stands now, I won't be coming back because I need access to the internet and I don't like having to find some place else in town to enjoy it. Plus when using my smartphone it kept exiting the wifi connection due to "slow connection times" so unbeknownst to me when I thought I was using my wifi on my phone, it was actually pulling from my data usage. Luckily, I caught it and turned off my phone. In the 4 days I've spent here so far, it had managed to eat up 75% of my data plan, because the wifi was exited. Oh and one other thing.. when I went to use the dryer, there were some articles of clothing from the previous guest still in there along with a bandaid! Apparently the service staff doesn't check the washer and dryers.. so be prepared... Also no direct beach access, so be prepared to drive if you want to get to the beach.

This is a great resort for a family and if you like to walk to the town of kona is only about 18 minutes! The resorts has several Gas Grills if you want to cook outside! We did not attempt to attend any activities at the resort because we had activities to attend off site! Lots of restaurants to eat at but i would highly recommend The Lava-Java for breakfast! The cinnamon bun is to die for!!! The pools are nice and clean but a little small but you are going to the Ocean anyway Right!!!! If you need anything the resort will attempt to help you with Good Choices for where to go for what you are wanting to accomplish ! The internet is ok in the am but spotty after 4:00 when everyone starts coming back from Hilo or other sights on the Big Island! The timeshare pitch (we were staying 2 weeks) so i missed it or wife must of made them aware that we were on VACATION! Remember to enjoy the sights and get a Car Rental ! You DO NOT need a 4 wheel drive to enjoy 98% of the Big Island! The Wyndham Kona Coast is a MUST STAY if you are going to Kona! The family cannot wait till we can return to the Big Island and i am proud to say " i would stay here again" and would recommend this Resort to family and friends without hesitation ! P.S. Get out there and enjoy the Big Island !!!!!!!! Room Tip: Ask to be placed up the hill as far as possible! If not, you will be looking at a White tent! See more room tips Green Features: You are in Hawaii so Everyone is into the environment! If you go to Costco or WalMart you will need to bring bags or buy a bag for .30 cents!

Aloha, I thank you for the wonderful review for Kona Hawaiian resort. And thank you for sharing great travel tips for everyone planning their Hawaiian vacation. Mahalo.

Excellent room size (2 bedroom/2 bath), nice beds, lanai, well-supplied condominium, air-conditioning, and 2 televisions. Overall, very nice accommodations. The grounds provide for a Hawaiian garden experience. It is a beautiful resort. Areas for improvement would include larger-sized pools (2), Internet service (Internet was slow to non-existent at times, weekly activities (redundant and of low quality), fitness facility (small and dated), poolside bar (it was not functioning during our stay), and timeshare sales pitches (Don't pitch Club Wyndham when a guest is simply asking for directions or entertainment advice). Kona is a fantastic place. The waters are simply astonishing regarding warmth and clarity. We would return to Kona in a heartbeat. Prior to staying at Wyndham Kona again, I would expect some significant upgrades to the resort.

Aloha, Great to hear that you enjoyed our spacious 2 -bedroom accomadations and other amenities and facilities offered. Thank you for this feedback for Kona Hawaiian. This will allow us to continue to enhance the vacation experience at our resort and to know other opportunities to improve to make your stay better in the future. Mahalo.

Nice in all respects. Across the street from the coast. 15 minute walk from downtown (aka no need to drive after some umbrella drinks...). Very nice, condo-style units -- spacious with kitchen and family room. Nice pools. Clean/well-maintained. Only negative is that they try to sell you more timeshare points and excursions pretty hard -- think this is normal for timeshare places. The excursions are through Expedia and are high quality,

Aloha, Great to hear abour your experience staying at Kona Hawaiian resort. I thank you for your comments, and we'll share it with all staff. We look forward for your vacation. Mahalo.

Stayed here in June 2014 with our family of 6, including twenty-somethings. Had a unit up the hill where it was really quiet and everyone enjoyed the sleep! Resort is handy to everything. Great kitchen for all of the chefs to work around one another! Rooms were clean and the washer/dryer was essential for washing and drying beach towels after the beach trips! key factor: the resort keeps a hut full of beach paraphernalia - no need to go to Costco or Walmart for chairs or umbrellas! Resort pool (upper) clean and gorgeous views. It would have been really nice to be able to order a cocktail, but there is no tiki bar and anyway that was not essential. We loved the big island and encourage others to stay here and take advantage of the location - near Kona and able to walk to shop or dinners, easy drive to any beach on the west side of the island, easy to get to the "cloud forest" for coffee tour, and easy to drive to Mauna Kea and Hilo. Highly recommend the helicopter tour of the island. Beautiful. Room Tip: Upstairs units on the hill are quieter and have a view of the ocean. See more room tips

Aloha, Thank you for the great feedback for Kona Hawaiian. Great to hear that all family members enjoyed Hawaiian vacation including the resort accommodation. We look forward to your next visit. Mahalo.

Location was perfect for quiet and peaceful vacation. Close to amenities - just a short walk away or jump in the car for snorkeling. Really appreciated the staff here...Reasonably priced in comparison to several hotels without kitchens in the units.

Aloha, Thank you very much for sharing your wonderful experience at the resort. we are glad that you and your family had enjoy the Island adventure. Mahalo,

Recently stayed here for 7 nights and overall we're very pleased. After looking at photos online and reviews I was skeptical about choosing this resort. Upon arrival and check in, the unit and resort exceeded my expectations. Large unit with updated furniture and well stocked kitchenware...non stick pan was super. Two minor complaints... the only dining table was outside and there were lots of flies, insects. Possible screening in would help. Also, pools were small and kids were bored. That said, we didn't spend a whole lot of time in unit or at pools. Would return again. Room Tip: Second floor to void noise. See more room tips

Aloha, It's was a pleasure to have you as our guest here in the resort, thank you very much for all the wonderful words that you experience with us. We are glad that we meet your expectation to our resort. We love to see you here again. Mahalo

Stayed here July 2014. Units have nice layout but the furniture is old and uncomfortable. The carpet is old and I wonder why in a place near sandy beaches it isn't tiled anyway. The spa tub in the master bedroom is one of those like in the dial is commercials... Only one person can get in at a time... The grounds were pretty. The staff were friendly. Pools were small but ok. Location is not on the beach and across the street the beach is rocky so you have to drive to sandy beach area. Otherwise location is short drive distance to grocery and restaurants nearby. Room Tip: Blogs are two stories with stair access to upper units. If stairs are a challenge ask for lower lev... See more room tips

Aloha, Thank you kindly for all the wonderful words that you shared to us it's greatly appreciated. The resort is close to the beach and all the restaurant is only a minutes away. As for the units they've been renovated 5 years ago with new carpets and furnitures. Mahalo,

We booked this resort through a Hawaiian Airlines package deal. I thought that the price was incredible for the room quality. Our family of six attended (three adults/three kids) and we had a two bedroom/two bath condo. We arrived at the hotel pretty early in the morning (around 8:30am). We were told that check-in wasn't until 4pm and no rooms were currently available, however, the lady wrote down my cell phone number and said that she would call as soon as a room became available. The lady offered to store our luggage for us, too. It was around noon that I got a call from the front desk, stating that our room was ready. I thought that the space of the unit was perfect, and the layout was also great. The six of us slept comfortably in the room. I've read some reviews that state the internet isn't the greatest. I can vouch for that. The internet isn't the greatest, but I didn't mind. It was actually nice to break away from technology for a few days and enjoy our vacation. The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that we weren't told (upon check-in), that our room wouldn't be serviced while we were there. I found out on our third day (by reading the information book in the room), that the rooms were only serviced mid-week. If you want clean towels you have to wash them yourself with the laundry detergent provided in the room. I guess if you want more shampoo/conditioner, you need to go to the front desk and request that. I didn't mind washing our towels, but it would have been helpful if I had known upon check-in that our room wasn't going to be serviced. I would definitely stay there again.

Aloha, We greatly appreciate all the wonderful comments that you gave us during your stay in Kona hawaiian resort. We apologize about the internet connection that occur during your stay. Mahalo,

This is a very nice Kona Resort. The units are spacious and out room was immaculate upon checking in. Found it to be very quiet also, which I don't think I've ever experienced before in a "timeshare resort". The timeshare presentation was typical of most. Not a whole lot of pressure and the presenters were polite. My one and only complaint about the resort had to do with their wi-fi. It is absolutely horrible, AT&T is the provider and they just guaranteed me not switching to them because of the shoddy experience I had with it here at the resort. And they can't blame it on being in Kona. I stayed one night at the Royal Kona while here and the wifi was excellent... So Wyndham, please get your act together on this. As it stands now, I won't be coming back because I need access to the internet and I don't like having to find some place else in town to enjoy it. Plus when using my smartphone it kept exiting the wifi connection due to "slow connection times" so unbeknownst to me when I thought I was using my wifi on my phone, it was actually pulling from my data usage. Luckily, I caught it and turned off my phone. In the 4 days I've spent here so far, it had managed to eat up 75% of my data plan, because the wifi was exited. Oh and one other thing.. when I went to use the dryer, there were some articles of clothing from the previous guest still in there along with a bandaid! Apparently the service staff doesn't check the washer and dryers.. so be prepared... Also no direct beach access, so be prepared to drive if you want to get to the beach.

Thank you for this great feedback. This will allow us to continue to enhance the vacation experience at our resort. Mahalo.

Recently stayed here, 8/1-8/8. We found the unit to be quite comfortable. I told the Activities desk that we were not interested in the timeshare presentation and it was never brought up again. The only issue I had was that with Iselle approaching the island of Hawaii, we had to initiate contact with the staff regarding their emergency plan for guests. We would definitely stay here again.

Aloha, Thank you for your review for Kona Hawaiian resort. And we look forward for you next visit. Mahalo
